    "The project aims to conduct textual analysis of the Federal Reserve's (FED) Monetary Policy Reports through the deployment of Python-based software. This report is written semi-annually and provided to Congress containing discussions on the \"conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects for the future.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we develop a web scraping script to extract textual data from the FED's website. Subsequently, we use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package to preprocess the text, including tokenization, stemming, and converting words to lowercase. Next, the Loughran McDonald Sentiment Dictionary is employed to transform the cleaned qualitative text data into a quantitative measure of the FED's communication tone. This communication measure is then be regressed against the output gap and inflation gap, obtained via API, to assess the sensitivity of the FED's communication to these macroeconomic variables. Throughout the project, we employ various visualisation and analysis packages to explore the data and conduct preliminary analysis. \n",

    "Finally, we plan to develop a user-friendly interface for easy access and interpretation of our findings. **IF WE GET TIME**"

2024\\nSemiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\\nChair Jerome H. Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on March 7, 2024.\\nChairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nThe Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward these objectives over the past year.\\nWhile inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s (FOMC) objective of 2 percent, it has eased substantially, and the slowing in inflation has occurred without a significant increase in unemployment. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have been moving into better balance.\\nEven so, the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks and is acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. The FOMC is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\\nI will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nEconomic activity expanded at a strong pace over the past year. For 2023 as a whole, gross domestic product increased 3.1 percent, bolstered by solid consumer demand and improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.\\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have continued to come into better balance. Since the middle of last year, payroll job gains have averaged 239,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has remained near historical lows, at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, particularly among individuals aged 25 to 54, and a continued strong pace of immigration. Job vacancies have declined, and nominal wage growth has been easing. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. The strong labor market over the past two years has also helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.1\\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above the FOMC\\'s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent, a notable slowing from 2022 that was widespread across both goods and services prices. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nAfter significantly tightening the stance of monetary policy since early 2022, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since its meeting last July. We have also continued to shrink our balance sheet at a brisk pace and in a predictable manner. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.\\nWe believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have seen in inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on March 8, 2023.\\nChairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nMy colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation is causing significant hardship, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Our policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.\\nI will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nThe data from January on employment, consumer spending, manufacturing production, and inflation have partly reversed the softening trends that we had seen in the data just a month ago. Some of this reversal likely reflects the unseasonably warm weather in January in much of the country. Still, the breadth of the reversal along with revisions to the previous quarter suggests that inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\\nFrom a broader perspective, inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year but remains well above the FOMC\\'s longer-run objective of 2 percent. The 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices has slowed from its peak of 7 percent in June to 5.4 percent in January as energy prices have declined and supply chain bottlenecks have eased.\\nOver the past 12 months, core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was 4.7 percent. As supply chain bottlenecks have eased and tighter policy has restrained demand, inflation in the core goods sector has fallen. And while housing services inflation remains too high, the flattening out in rents evident in recently signed leases points to a deceleration in this component of inflation over the year ahead.\\nThat said, there is little sign of disinflation thus far in the category of core services excluding housing, which accounts for more than half of core consumer expenditures. To restore price stability, we will need to see lower inflation in this sector, and there will very likely be some softening in labor market conditions. Although nominal wage gains have slowed somewhat in recent months, they remain above what is consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity. Strong wage growth is good for workers but only if it is not eroded by inflation.\\nTurning to growth, the U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real gross domestic product rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent. Although consumer spending appears to be expanding at a solid pace this quarter, other recent indicators point to subdued growth of spending and production. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent in January, its lowest level since 1969. Job gains remained very strong in January, while the supply of labor has continued to lag.1 As of the end of December, there were 1.9 job openings for each unemployed individual, close to the all-time peak recorded last March, while unemployment insurance claims have remained near historical lows.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nWith inflation well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and with the labor market remaining extremely tight, the FOMC has continued to tighten the stance of monetary policy, raising interest rates by 4-1/2 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.2\\nWe are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee slowed the pace of interest rate increases over its past two meetings. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.\\nAlthough inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. As I mentioned, the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time.\\nOur overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on June 22, 2023.\\nChairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nWe at the Fed remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, and without it, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\\nI will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the first five months of the year, job gains averaged a robust 314,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May, at 3.7 percent. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.1\\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in April, total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) came in at 4.0 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.3 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nWith inflation remaining well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and with labor market conditions remaining tight, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points since early last year and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.2 We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.\\nThe economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.3 The extent of these effects remains uncertain.\\nIn light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the FOMC decided last week to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. Nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at last week\\'s meeting, considering how far and how fast we have moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.\\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\\nBefore concluding, let me briefly address the condition of the banking sector. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. As detailed in the box on financial stability in the June Monetary Policy Report, the Federal Reserve, together with the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, took decisive action in March to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system. The recent bank failures, including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and the resulting banking stress have highlighted the importance of ensuring we have the appropriate rules and supervisory practices for banks of this size. We are committed to addressing these vulnerabilities to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system.\\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\\nThank you.

The conflict is causing tremendous hardship for the Ukrainian people. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, and we will be monitoring the situation closely.\\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. We pursue these goals based solely on data and objective analysis, and we are committed to doing so in a clear and transparent manner so that the American people and their representatives in Congress understand our policy actions and can hold us accountable. I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nEconomic activity expanded at a robust 5 1/2 percent pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year, but with cases having declined sharply since mid-January, the slowdown seems to have been brief.\\nThe labor market is extremely tight. Payroll employment rose by 6.7 million in 2021, and job gains were robust in January. The unemployment rate declined substantially over the past year and stood at 4.0 percent in January, reaching the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has ticked up, labor supply remains subdued. As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, an unprecedented number of workers are quitting to take new jobs, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years.\\nInflation increased sharply last year and is now running well above our longer-run objective of 2 percent. Demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. These supply disruptions have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus, and price increases are now spreading to a broader range of goods and services.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nWe understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.\\nThe Committee will continue to monitor incoming economic data and will adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate to manage risks that could impede the attainment of its goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. We continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year as supply constraints ease and demand moderates because of the waning effects of fiscal support and the removal of monetary policy accommodation. But we are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation expectations and inflation itself from a number of factors. We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched while promoting a sustainable expansion and a strong labor market.\\nOur monetary policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. We have phased out our net asset purchases. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month.\\nThe process of removing policy accommodation in current circumstances will involve both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As the FOMC noted in January, the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Reducing our balance sheet will commence after the process of raising interest rates has begun, and will proceed in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments.\\nThe near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.\\nMaintaining the trust and confidence of the public is essential to our work. Last month, the Federal Reserve finalized a comprehensive set of new ethics rules to substantially strengthen the investment restrictions for senior Federal Reserve officials. These new rules will guard against even the appearance of any conflict of interest. They are tough and best in class in government, here and around the world.\\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on June 23, 2022.\\nChairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nI will begin with one overarching message. At the Fed, we understand the hardship high inflation is causing. We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we are moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\\nI will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE (personal consumption expenditures) prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.9 percent. The available data for May suggest the core measure likely held at that pace or eased slightly last month. Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and fuel and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID-19-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate ongoing supply chain disruptions. Over the past year, inflation also increased rapidly in many foreign economies, as discussed in a box in the June Monetary Policy Report.\\nOverall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent indicators suggest that real gross domestic product growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The tightening in financial conditions that we have seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply.\\nThe labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50‑year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust. Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. A box in the June Monetary Policy Report discusses developments in employment and earnings across all major demographic groups. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nThe Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\\nAgainst the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so. With inflation well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and an extremely tight labor market, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate at each of our past three meetings, resulting in a 1-1/2 percentage point increase in the target range so far this year. The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In May, we announced plans for reducing the size of our balance sheet and, shortly thereafter, began the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. Financial conditions have been tightening since last fall and have now tightened significantly, reflecting both policy actions that we have already taken and anticipated actions.\\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. We will make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., on February 24, 2021.\\nChairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide support and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to households, businesses, and communities. Today I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nThe path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in recent months is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation. Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, momentum slowed substantially, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus. In recent weeks, the number of new cases and hospitalizations has been falling, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year. However, the economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain.\\nHousehold spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including leisure and hospitality. In contrast, household spending on goods picked up encouragingly in January after moderating late last year. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to unprecedented fiscal and monetary actions, which have provided essential support to many households, businesses, and communities.\\nAs with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed. Over the three months ending in January, employment rose at an average monthly rate of only 29,000. Continued progress in many industries has been tempered by significant losses in industries such as leisure and hospitality, where the resurgence in the virus and increased social distancing have weighed further on activity. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work. As discussed in the February Monetary Policy Report, the economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers and for African Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.\\nThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices partially rebounded over the rest of last year. However, for some of the sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.\\nWhile we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, developments point to an improved outlook for later this year. In particular, ongoing progress in vaccinations should help speed the return to normal activities. In the meantime, we should continue to follow the advice of health experts to observe social-distancing measures and wear masks.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nI will now turn to monetary policy. In the second half of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee completed our first-ever public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. We undertook this review because the U.S. economy has changed in ways that matter for monetary policy. The review\\'s purpose was to identify improvements to our policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives. The review involved extensive outreach to a broad range of people and groups through a series of Fed Listens events.\\nAs described in the February Monetary Policy Report, in August, the Committee unanimously adopted its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Our revised statement shares many features with its predecessor. For example, we have not changed our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. However, we did make some key changes. Regarding our employment goal, we emphasize that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, we state that our policy decisions will be informed by our \"assessments of shortfalls of employment from its maximum level\" rather than by \"deviations from its maximum level.\"1 This change means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. Regarding our price-stability goal, we state that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This means that, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. With this change, we aim to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal. Well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation goals, particularly in the current low interest rate environment in which our main policy tool is likely to be more frequently constrained by the lower bound.\\nWe have implemented our new framework by forcefully deploying our policy tools. As noted in our January policy statement, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee\\'s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at their current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward our goals. These purchases, and the associated increase in the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.\\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has been taking actions to support more directly the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) facilities are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place.\\nWe understand that our actions affect households, businesses, and communities across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.\\nThank you, I am happy to take your questions.\\n\\n1.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 15, 2021.\\nChairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. We pursue these goals based solely on data and objective analysis, and we are committed to doing so in a clear and transparent manner. Today I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nOver the first half of 2021, ongoing vaccinations have led to a reopening of the economy and strong economic growth, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. Real gross domestic product this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by strong fiscal support, accommodative financial conditions, and the reopening of the economy. Housing demand remains very strong, and overall business investment is increasing at a solid pace. As described in the Monetary Policy Report, supply constraints have been restraining activity in some industries, most notably in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production so far this year.\\nConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.\\nAs discussed in the Monetary Policy Report, the pandemic-induced declines in employment last year were largest for workers with lower wages and for African Americans and Hispanics. Despite substantial improvements for all racial and ethnic groups, the hardest-hit groups still have the most ground left to regain.\\nInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy.\\nTo avoid sustained periods of unusually low or high inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s (FOMC) monetary policy framework seeks longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent, the Committee\\'s longer-run inflation objective. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved up from their pandemic lows and are in a range that is broadly consistent with the FOMC\\'s longer-run inflation goal. Two boxes in the July Monetary Policy Report discuss recent developments in inflation and inflation expectations.\\nSustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system, and we continue to monitor vulnerabilities here. While asset valuations have generally risen with improving fundamentals as well as increased investor risk appetite, household balance sheets are, on average, quite strong, business leverage has been declining from high levels, and the institutions at the core of the financial system remain resilient.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nI will now turn to monetary policy. At our June meeting, the FOMC kept the federal funds rate near zero and maintained the pace of our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.\\nWe continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee\\'s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. As the Committee reiterated in our June policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. As always, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, we will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal.\\nIn addition, we are continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage‑backed securities at least at their current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. These purchases have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy.\\nAt our June meeting, the Committee discussed the economy\\'s progress toward our goals since we adopted our asset purchase guidance last December. While reaching the standard of \"substantial further progress\" is still a ways off, participants expect that progress will continue. We will continue these discussions in coming meetings. As we have said, we will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases.\\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. The resumption of our Fed Listens initiative will further strengthen our ongoing efforts to learn from a broad range of groups about how they are recovering from the economic hardships brought on by the pandemic. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to support the recovery and foster progress toward our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\\nThank you.

Congress has given us an important degree of independence to pursue these goals based solely on data and objective analysis. This independence brings with it an obligation to explain clearly how we pursue our goals. Today I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation\\r\\nThe economic expansion is well into its 11th year, and it is the longest on record. Over the second half of last year, economic activity increased at a moderate pace and the labor market strengthened further, as the economy appeared resilient to the global headwinds that had intensified last summer. Inflation has been low and stable but has continued to run below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) symmetric 2 percent objective.\\nJob gains averaged 200,000 per month in the second half of last year, and an additional 225,000 jobs were added in January. The pace of job gains has remained above what is needed to provide jobs for new workers entering the labor force, allowing the unemployment rate to move down further over the course of last year. The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent last month and has been near half-century lows for more than a year. Job openings remain plentiful. Employers are increasingly willing to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a result, the benefits of a strong labor market have become more widely shared. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities are finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and levels of education. Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.\\nGross domestic product rose at a moderate rate over the second half of last year. Growth in consumer spending moderated toward the end of the year following earlier strong increases, but the fundamentals supporting household spending remain solid. Residential investment turned up in the second half, but business investment and exports were weak, largely reflecting sluggish growth abroad and trade developments. Those same factors weighed on activity at the nation's factories, whose output declined over the first half of 2019 and has been little changed, on net, since then. The February Monetary Policy Report discusses the recent weakness in manufacturing. Some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, but risks to the outlook remain. In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.\\nInflation ran below the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective throughout 2019. Over the 12 months through December, overall inflation based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also 1.6 percent. Over the next few months, we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent, as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation.\\nThe nation faces important longer-run challenges. Labor force participation by individuals in their prime working years is at its highest rate in more than a decade. However, it remains lower than in most other advanced economies, and there are troubling labor market disparities across racial and ethnic groups and across regions of the country. In addition, although it is encouraging that productivity growth, the main engine for raising wages and living standards over the longer term, has moved up recently, productivity gains have been subpar throughout this economic expansion. Finding ways to boost labor force participation and productivity growth would benefit Americans and should remain a national priority.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nI will now turn to monetary policy. Over the second half of 2019, the FOMC shifted to a more accommodative stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from weaker global growth and trade developments and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective. We lowered the federal funds target range at our July, September, and October meetings, bringing the current target range to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. At our subsequent meetings, with some uncertainties surrounding trade having diminished and amid some signs that global growth may be stabilizing, the Committee left the policy rate unchanged. The FOMC believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate. Of course, policy is not on a preset course. If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\\nTaking a longer view, there has been a decline over the past quarter-century in the level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and the economy operating at its full potential. This low interest rate environment may limit the ability of central banks to reduce policy interest rates enough to support the economy during a downturn. With this concern in mind, we have been conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Public engagement is at the heart of this effort. Through our Fed Listens events, we have been hearing from representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. The February Monetary Policy Report shares some of what we have learned. The insights we have gained from these events have informed our framework discussions, as reported in the minutes of our meetings. We will share our conclusions when we finish the review, likely around the middle of the year.\\nThe current low interest rate environment also means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn. A more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy's growth over the long term.\\nFinally, I will briefly review our planned technical operations to implement monetary policy. The February Monetary Policy Report provides details of our operations to date. Last October, the FOMC announced a plan to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations. These actions have been successful in providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effective control of the federal funds rate. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, we intend to gradually transition away from the active use of repo operations. Also, as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow our balance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our liabilities. All of these technical measures support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. They are not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. As always, we stand ready to adjust the details of our technical operations as conditions warrant.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., on June 17, 2020.\\nChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nOur country continues to face a difficult and challenging time, as the pandemic is causing tremendous hardship here in the United States and around the world. The coronavirus outbreak is, first and foremost, a public health crisis. The most important response has come from our health-care workers. On behalf of the Federal Reserve, I want to express our sincere gratitude to these dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nBeginning in mid-March, economic activity fell at an unprecedented speed in response to the outbreak of the virus and the measures taken to control its spread. Even after the unexpectedly positive May employment report, nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the reported unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent. The decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) this quarter is likely to be the most severe on record. The burden of the downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans. Instead, those least able to withstand the downturn have been affected most. As discussed in the June Monetary Policy Report, low-income households have experienced, by far, the sharpest drop in employment, while job losses of African Americans, Hispanics, and women have been greater than that of other groups. If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing.\\nRecently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity. With an easing of restrictions on mobility and commerce and the extension of federal loans and grants, some businesses are opening up, while stimulus checks and unemployment benefits are supporting household incomes and spending. As a result, employment moved higher in May. That said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery. Much of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it. Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.\\nMoreover, the longer the downturn lasts, the greater the potential for longer-term damage from permanent job loss and business closures. Long periods of unemployment can erode workers' skills and hurt their future job prospects. Persistent unemployment can also negate the gains made by many disadvantaged Americans during the long expansion and described to us at our Fed Listens events. The pandemic is presenting acute risks to small businesses, as discussed in the Monetary Policy Report. If a small or medium-sized business becomes insolvent because the economy recovers too slowly, we lose more than just that business. These businesses are the heart of our economy and often embody the work of generations.\\nWith weak demand and large price declines for some goods and services—such as apparel, gasoline, air travel, and hotels—consumer price inflation has dropped noticeably in recent months. But indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have been fairly steady. As output stabilizes and the recovery moves ahead, inflation should stabilize and then gradually move back up over time closer to our symmetric 2 percent objective. Inflation is nonetheless likely to remain below our objective for some time.\\nMonetary Policy and Federal Reserve Actions to Support the Flow of Credit\\r\\nThe Federal Reserve's response to this extraordinary period is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. \\nIn March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, reflecting the effects of COVID-19 on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and the heightened risks to the outlook. We expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\\nWe have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the economy. Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy. As described in the June Monetary Policy Report, these purchases have helped restore orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions. As market functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually reduced the pace of these purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months at least at the current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.\\nTo provide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, established 11 credit and liquidity facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The June Monetary Policy Report provides details on these facilities, which fall into two categories: stabilizing short-term funding markets and providing more-direct support for credit across the economy.\\nTo help stabilize short-term funding markets, the Federal Reserve set up the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Money Market Liquidity Facility to stem rapid outflows from prime money market funds. The Fed also established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, which provides loans against good collateral to primary dealers that are critical intermediaries in short-term funding markets.\\nTo more directly support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve established a number of facilities. To support the small business sector, we established the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to bolster the effectiveness of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act's (CARES Act) Paycheck Protection Program. Our Main Street Lending Program, which we are in the process of launching, supports lending to both small and midsized businesses. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility supports lending to both businesses and consumers. To support the employment and spending of investment-grade businesses, we established two corporate credit facilities. And to help U.S. state and local governments manage cash flow pressures and serve their communities, we set up the Municipal Liquidity Facility.\\nThe tools that the Federal Reserve is using under its 13(3) authority are appropriately reserved for times of emergency. When this crisis is behind us, we will put them away. The June Monetary Policy Report reviews the implications of these tools for the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\\nMany of these facilities have been supported by funding from the CARES Act. We will be disclosing, on a monthly basis, names and details of participants in each such facility; amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and overall costs, revenues, and fees for each facility. We embrace our responsibility to the American people to be as transparent as possible, and we appreciate that the need for transparency is heightened when we are called upon to use our emergency powers.\\nWe recognize that our actions are only part of a broader public-sector response. Congress's passage of the CARES Act was critical in enabling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to establish many of the lending programs. The CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.\\nI want to end by acknowledging the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country. The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation. We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality. I speak for my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say, there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism and there should be no place for it in our society. Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy.\\nWe understand that the work of the Federal Reserve touches communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on February 27, 2019.\\nGood morning. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the Committee, I am happy to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\nLet me start by saying that my colleagues and I strongly support the goals Congress has set for monetary policy--maximum employment and price stability. We are committed to providing transparency about the Federal Reserve's policies and programs. Congress has entrusted us with an important degree of independence so that we can pursue our mandate without concern for short-term political considerations. We appreciate that our independence brings with it the need to provide transparency so that Americans and their representatives in Congress understand our policy actions and can hold us accountable. We are always grateful for opportunities, such as today's hearing, to demonstrate the Fed's deep commitment to transparency and accountability.\\nToday I will review the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy. I will also describe several recent improvements to our communications practices to enhance our transparency.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nThe economy grew at a strong pace, on balance, last year, and employment and inflation remain close to the Federal Reserve's statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices‑‑our dual mandate.\\nBased on the available data, we estimate that gross domestic product (GDP) rose a little less than 3 percent last year following a 2.5 percent increase in 2017. Last year's growth was led by strong gains in consumer spending and increases in business investment. Growth was supported by increases in employment and wages, optimism among households and businesses, and fiscal policy actions. In the last couple of months, some data have softened but still point to spending gains this quarter. While the partial government shutdown created significant hardship for government workers and many others, the negative effects on the economy are expected to be fairly modest and to largely unwind over the next several months.\\nThe job market remains strong. Monthly job gains averaged 223,000 in 2018, and payrolls increased an additional 304,000 in January. The unemployment rate stood at 4 percent in January, a very low level by historical standards, and job openings remain abundant. Moreover, the ample availability of job opportunities appears to have encouraged some people to join the workforce and some who otherwise might have left to remain in it. As a result, the labor force participation rate for people in their prime working years‑‑the share of people ages 25 to 54 who are either working or looking for work‑‑has continued to increase over the past year. In another welcome development, we are seeing signs of stronger wage growth.\\nThe job market gains in recent years have benefited a wide range of families and individuals. Indeed, recent wage gains have been strongest for lower-skilled workers. That said, disparities persist across various groups of workers and different parts of the country. For example, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are still well above the jobless rates for whites and Asians. Likewise, the percentage of the population with a job is noticeably lower in rural communities than in urban areas, and that gap has widened over the past decade. The February Monetary Policy Report provides additional information on employment disparities between rural and urban areas.\\nOverall consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is estimated to have been 1.7 percent in December, held down by recent declines in energy prices. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, is estimated at 1.9 percent. At our January meeting, my colleagues and I generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace, albeit somewhat slower than in 2018, and the job market to remain strong. Recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) longer-run goal of 2 percent for a time, but aside from those transitory effects, we expect that inflation will run close to 2 percent.\\nWhile we view current economic conditions as healthy and the economic outlook as favorable, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals. Financial markets became more volatile toward year-end, and financial conditions are now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly China and Europe. And uncertainty is elevated around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations. We will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve.\\nIn addition, our nation faces important longer-run challenges. For example, productivity growth, which is what drives rising real wages and living standards over the longer term, has been too low. Likewise, in contrast to 25 years ago, labor force participation among prime-age men and women is now lower in the United States than in most other advanced economies. Other longer-run trends, such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes, also remain important challenges. And it is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path. As a nation, addressing these pressing issues could contribute greatly to the longer-run health and vitality of the U.S. economy.\\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nOver the second half of 2018, as the labor market kept strengthening and economic activity continued to expand strongly, the FOMC gradually moved interest rates toward levels that are more normal for a healthy economy. Specifically, at our September and December meetings we decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at each, putting the current range at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.\\nAt our December meeting, we stressed that the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook. We also noted that we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the outlook. In January, with inflation pressures muted, the FOMC determined that the cumulative effects of these developments, along with ongoing government policy uncertainty, warranted taking a patient approach with regard to future policy changes. Going forward, our policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and will take into account new information as economic conditions and the outlook evolve.\\nFor guideposts on appropriate policy, the FOMC routinely looks at monetary policy rules that recommend a level for the federal funds rate based on measures of inflation and the cyclical position of the U.S. economy. The February Monetary Policy Report gives an update on monetary policy rules. I continue to find these rules to be helpful benchmarks, but, of course, no simple rule can adequately capture the full range of factors the Committee must assess in conducting policy. We do, however, conduct monetary policy in a systematic manner to promote our long-run goals of maximum employment and stable prices. As part of this approach, we strive to communicate clearly about our monetary policy decisions.\\nWe have also continued to gradually shrink the size of our balance sheet by reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency securities. The Federal Reserve's total assets declined about $310 billion since the middle of last year and currently stand at close to $4.0 trillion. Relative to their peak level in 2014, banks' reserve balances with the Federal Reserve have declined by around $1.2 trillion, a drop of more than 40 percent.\\nIn light of the substantial progress we have made in reducing reserves, and after extensive deliberations, the Committee decided at our January meeting to continue over the longer run to implement policy with our current operating procedure. That is, we will continue to use our administered rates to control the policy rate, with an ample supply of reserves so that active management of reserves is not required. Having made this decision, the Committee can now evaluate the appropriate timing and approach for the end of balance sheet runoff. I would note that we are prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. In the longer run, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities such as currency and bank reserves. The February Monetary Policy Report describes these liabilities and reviews the factors that influence their size over the longer run.\\nI will conclude by mentioning some further progress we have made in improving transparency. Late last year we launched two new publications: The first, Financial Stability Report, shares our assessment of the resilience of the U.S. financial system, and the second, Supervision and Regulation Report, provides information about our activities as a bank supervisor and regulator. Last month we began conducting press conferences after every FOMC meeting instead of every other one. The change will allow me to more fully and more frequently explain the Committee's thinking. Last November we announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive review of the strategies, tools, and communications practices we use to pursue our congressionally assigned goals for monetary policy. This review will include outreach to a broad range of stakeholders across the country. The February Monetary Policy Report provides further discussion of these initiatives.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 11, 2019.\\nChairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress.\\nLet me start by saying that my colleagues and I strongly support the goals of maximum employment and price stability that Congress has set for monetary policy. We are committed to providing clear explanations about our policies and activities. Congress has given us an important degree of independence so that we can effectively pursue our statutory goals based on objective analysis and data. We appreciate that our independence brings with it an obligation for transparency so that you and the public can hold us accountable.\\nToday I will review the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy. I will also provide an update of our ongoing public review of our framework for setting monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook \\r\\nThe economy performed reasonably well over the first half of 2019, and the current expansion is now in its 11th year. However, inflation has been running below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) symmetric 2 percent objective, and crosscurrents, such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth, have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook.\\nThe labor market remains healthy. Job gains averaged 172,000 per month from January through June. This number is lower than the average of 223,000 a month last year but above the pace needed to provide jobs for new workers entering the labor force. Consequently, the unemployment rate moved down from 3.9 percent in December to 3.7 percent in June, close to its lowest level in 50 years. Job openings remain plentiful, and employers are increasingly willing to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a result, the benefits of a strong job market have been more widely shared in recent years. Indeed, wage gains have been greater for lower-skilled workers. That said, individuals in some demographic groups and in certain parts of the country continue to face challenges. For example, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics remain well above the rates for whites and Asians. Likewise, the share of the population with a job is higher in urban areas than in rural communities, and this gap widened over the past decade. A box in the July Monetary Policy Report provides a comparison of employment and wage gains over the current expansion for individuals with different levels of education.\\nGross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 2019, similar to last year's pace. This strong reading was driven largely by net exports and inventories—components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum. The more reliable drivers of growth in the economy are consumer spending and business investment. While growth in consumer spending was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace. However, growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably, and overall growth in the second quarter appears to have moderated. The slowdown in business fixed investment may reflect concerns about trade tensions and slower growth in the global economy. In addition, housing investment and manufacturing output declined in the first quarter and appear to have decreased again in the second quarter.\\nAfter running close to our 2 percent objective over much of last year, overall consumer price inflation, measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), declined earlier this year and stood at 1.5 percent in May. The 12-month change in core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, has also come down this year and was 1.6 percent in May.\\nOur baseline outlook is for economic growth to remain solid, labor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up over time to the Committee's 2 percent objective. However, uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months. In particular, economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies, and that weakness could affect the U.S. economy. Moreover, a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved, including trade developments, the federal debt ceiling, and Brexit. And there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate. We are carefully monitoring these developments, and we will continue to assess their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation.\\nThe nation also continues to confront important longer-run challenges. Labor force participation by those in their prime working years is now lower in the United States than in most other nations with comparable economies. As I mentioned, there are troubling labor market disparities across demographic groups and different parts of the country. The relative stagnation of middle and lower incomes and low levels of upward mobility for lower-income families are also ongoing concerns. In addition, finding ways to boost productivity growth, which leads to rising wages and living standards over the longer term, should remain a high national priority. And I remain concerned about the longer-term effects of high and rising federal debt, which can restrain private investment and, in turn, reduce productivity and overall economic growth. The longer-run vitality of the U.S. economy would benefit from efforts to address these issues.\\nMonetary Policy \\r\\nAgainst this backdrop, the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 2‑1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in the first half of this year. At our January, March, and May meetings, we stated that we would be patient as we determined what future adjustments to the federal funds rate might be appropriate to support our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\\nAt the time of our May meeting, we were mindful of the ongoing crosscurrents from global growth and trade, but there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating. The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China. Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate.\\nSince our May meeting, however, these crosscurrents have reemerged, creating greater uncertainty. Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments. Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed on net, raising concerns that weakness in the global economy will continue to affect the U.S. economy. These concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may have started to show through to incoming data.\\nIn our June meeting statement, we indicated that, in light of increased uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures, we would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Many FOMC participants saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy had strengthened. Since then, based on incoming data and other developments, it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. Inflation pressures remain muted.\\nThe FOMC has made a number of important decisions this year about our framework for implementing monetary policy and our plans for completing the reduction of the Fed's securities holdings. At our January meeting, we decided to continue to implement monetary policy using our current policy regime with ample reserves, and emphasized that we are prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. At our March meeting, we communicated our intention to slow, starting in May, the decline in the Fed's aggregate securities holdings and to end the reduction in these holdings in September. The July Monetary Policy Report provides details on these decisions.\\nThe July Monetary Policy Report also includes an update on monetary policy rules. The FOMC routinely looks at monetary policy rules that recommend a level for the federal funds rate based on inflation and unemployment rates. I continue to find these rules helpful, although using these rules requires careful judgment.\\nWe are conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the first review of its kind for the FOMC. Our motivation is to consider ways to improve the Committee's current policy framework and to best position the Fed to achieve maximum employment and price stability. The review has started with outreach to and consultation with a broad range of people and groups through a series of Fed Listens events. The FOMC will consider questions related to the review at upcoming meetings. We will publicly report the outcome of our discussions.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on March 1, 2018.\\nChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\nOn the occasion of my first appearance before this Committee as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, I want to express my appreciation for my predecessor, Chair Janet Yellen, and her important contributions. During her term as Chair, the economy continued to strengthen and Federal Reserve policymakers began to normalize both the level of interest rates and the size of the balance sheet. Together, Chair Yellen and I have worked to ensure a smooth leadership transition and provide for continuity in monetary policy. I also want to express my appreciation for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Finally, I want to affirm my continued support for the objectives assigned to us by the Congress--maximum employment and price stability--and for transparency about the Federal Reserve's policies and programs. Transparency is the foundation for our accountability, and I am committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we are doing it. Today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nThe U.S. economy grew at a solid pace over the second half of 2017 and into this year. Monthly job gains averaged 179,000 from July through December, and payrolls rose an additional 200,000 in January. This pace of job growth was sufficient to push the unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent, about 3/4 percentage point lower than a year earlier and the lowest level since December 2000. In addition, the labor force participation rate remained roughly unchanged, on net, as it has for the past several years--that is a sign of job market strength, given that retiring baby boomers are putting downward pressure on the participation rate. Strong job gains in recent years have led to widespread reductions in unemployment across the income spectrum and for all major demographic groups. For example, the unemployment rate for adults without a high school education has fallen from about 15 percent in 2009 to 5-1/2 percent in January of this year, while the jobless rate for those with a college degree has moved down from 5 percent to 2 percent over the same period. In addition, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are now at or below rates seen before the recession, although they are still significantly above the rate for whites. Wages have continued to grow moderately, with a modest acceleration in some measures, although the extent of the pickup likely has been damped in part by the weak pace of productivity growth in recent years.\\nTurning from the labor market to production, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the second half of 2017, 1 percentage point faster than its pace in the first half of the year. Economic growth in the second half was led by solid gains in consumer spending, supported by rising household incomes and wealth, and upbeat sentiment. In addition, growth in business investment stepped up sharply last year, which should support higher productivity growth in time. The housing market has continued to improve slowly. Economic activity abroad also has been solid in recent quarters, and the associated strengthening in the demand for U.S. exports has provided considerable support to our manufacturing industry.\\nAgainst this backdrop of solid growth and a strong labor market, inflation has been low and stable. In fact, inflation has continued to run below the 2 percent rate that the FOMC judges to be most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in December, about the same as in 2016. The core PCE price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food items and is a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period, somewhat less than in the previous year. We continue to view some of the shortfall in inflation last year as likely reflecting transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat; consistent with this view, the monthly readings were a little higher toward the end of the year than in earlier months.\\nAfter easing substantially during 2017, financial conditions in the United States have reversed some of that easing. At this point, we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. Indeed, the economic outlook remains strong. The robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending, solid economic growth among our trading partners should lead to further gains in U.S. exports, and upbeat business sentiment and strong sales growth will likely continue to boost business investment. Moreover, fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative. In this environment, we anticipate that inflation on a 12-month basis will move up this year and stabilize around the FOMC's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Wages should increase at a faster pace as well. The Committee views the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nI will now turn to monetary policy. The Congress has assigned us the goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Over the second half of 2017, the FOMC continued to gradually reduce monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at our December meeting, bringing the target to a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. In addition, in October we initiated a balance sheet normalization program to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. That program has been proceeding smoothly. These interest rate and balance sheet actions reflect the Committee's view that gradually reducing monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fostering a return of inflation to 2 percent.\\nIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the FOMC's view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.\\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary policy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our mandated objectives. Personally, I find these rule prescriptions helpful. Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account. I would like to note that this Monetary Policy Report provides further discussion of monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal Reserve's policy process, extending the analysis we introduced in July.\\nThank you.

Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 18, 2018.\\nGood morning. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the Committee, I am happy to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\nLet me start by saying that my colleagues and I strongly support the goals the Congress has set for monetary policy--maximum employment and price stability. We also support clear and open communication about the policies we undertake to achieve these goals. We owe you, and the public in general, clear explanations of what we are doing and why we are doing it. Monetary policy affects everyone and should be a mystery to no one. For the past three years, we have been gradually returning interest rates and the Fed\\'s securities holdings to more normal levels as the economy strengthens. We believe this is the best way we can help set conditions in which Americans who want a job can find one, and in which inflation remains low and stable.\\nI will review the current economic situation and outlook and then turn to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nSince I last testified here in February, the job market has continued to strengthen and inflation has moved up. In the most recent data, inflation was a little above 2 percent, the level that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, thinks will best achieve our price stability and employment objectives over the longer run. The latest figure was boosted by a significant increase in gasoline and other energy prices.\\nAn average of 215,000 net new jobs were created each month in the first half of this year. That number is somewhat higher than the monthly average for 2017. It is also a good deal higher than the average number of people who enter the work force each month on net. The unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage point over the first half of the year to 4.0 percent in June, near the lowest level of the past two decades. In addition, the share of the population that either has a job or has looked for one in the past month--the labor force participation rate--has not changed much since late 2013. This development is another sign of labor market strength. Part of what has kept the participation rate stable is that more working-age people have started looking for a job, which has helped make up for the large number of baby boomers who are retiring and leaving the labor force.\\nAnother piece of good news is that the robust conditions in the labor market are being felt by many different groups. For example, the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics have fallen sharply over the past few years and are now near their lowest levels since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began reporting data for these groups in 1972. Groups with higher unemployment rates have tended to benefit the most as the job market has strengthened. But jobless rates for these groups are still higher than those for whites. And while three-fourths of whites responded in a recent Federal Reserve survey that they were doing at least okay financially in 2017, only two-thirds of African Americans and Hispanics responded that way.\\nIncoming data show that, alongside the strong job market, the U.S. economy has grown at a solid pace so far this year. The value of goods and services produced in the economy--or gross domestic product--rose at a moderate annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter after adjusting for inflation. However, the latest data suggest that economic growth in the second quarter was considerably stronger than in the first. The solid pace of growth so far this year is based on several factors. Robust job gains, rising after-tax incomes, and optimism among households have lifted consumer spending in recent months. Investment by businesses has continued to grow at a healthy rate. Good economic performance in other countries has supported U.S. exports and manufacturing. And while housing construction has not increased this year, it is up noticeably from where it stood a few years ago.\\nI will turn now to inflation. After several years in which inflation ran below our 2 percent objective, the recent data are encouraging. The price index for personal consumption expenditures, which is an overall measure of prices paid by consumers, increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May. That number is up from 1.5 percent a year ago. Overall inflation increased partly because of higher oil prices, which caused a sharp rise in gasoline and other energy prices paid by consumers. Because energy prices move up and down a great deal, we also look at core inflation. Core inflation excludes energy and food prices and generally is a better indicator of future overall inflation. Core inflation was 2.0 percent for the 12 months ending in May, compared with 1.5 percent a year ago. We will continue to keep a close eye on inflation with the goal of keeping it near 2 percent.\\nLooking ahead, my colleagues on the FOMC and I expect that, with appropriate monetary policy, the job market will remain strong and inflation will stay near 2 percent over the next several years. This judgment reflects several factors. First, interest rates, and financial conditions more broadly, remain favorable to growth. Second, our financial system is much stronger than before the crisis and is in a good position to meet the credit needs of households and businesses. Third, federal tax and spending policies likely will continue to support the expansion. And, fourth, the outlook for economic growth abroad remains solid despite greater uncertainties in several parts of the world. What I have just described is what we see as the most likely path for the economy. Of course, the economic outcomes we experience often turn out to be a good deal stronger or weaker than our best forecast. For example, it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy as well as the size and timing of the economic effects of the recent changes in fiscal policy. Overall, we see the risk of the economy unexpectedly weakening as roughly balanced with the possibility of the economy growing faster than we currently anticipate.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nOver the first half of 2018 the FOMC has continued to gradually reduce monetary policy accommodation. In other words, we have continued to dial back the extra boost that was needed to help the economy recover from the financial crisis and recession. Specifically, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at both our March and June meetings, bringing the target to its current range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent. In addition, last October we started gradually reducing the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. That process has been running smoothly. Our policies reflect the strong performance of the economy and are intended to help make sure that this trend continues. The payment of interest on balances held by banks in their accounts at the Federal Reserve has played a key role in carrying out these policies, as the current Monetary Policy Report explains. Payment of interest on these balances is our principal tool for keeping the federal funds rate in the FOMC\\'s target range. This tool has made it possible for us to gradually return interest rates to a more normal level without disrupting financial markets and the economy.\\nAs I mentioned, after many years of running below our longer-run objective of 2 percent, inflation has recently moved close to that level. Our challenge will be to keep it there. Many factors affect inflation--some temporary and others longer lasting. Inflation will at times be above 2 percent and at other times below. We say that the 2 percent objective is \"symmetric\" because the FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our objective.\\nThe unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further. Americans who want jobs have a good chance of finding them. Moreover, wages are growing a little faster than they did a few years ago. That said, they still are not rising as fast as in the years before the crisis. One explanation could be that productivity growth has been low in recent years. On a brighter note, moderate wage growth also tells us that the job market is not causing high inflation.\\nWith a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that--for now--the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate. We are aware that, on the one hand, raising interest rates too slowly may lead to high inflation or financial market excesses. On the other hand, if we raise rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken and inflation could run persistently below our objective. The Committee will continue to weigh a wide range of relevant information when deciding what monetary policy will be appropriate. As always, our actions will depend on the economic outlook, which may change as we receive new data.\\nFor guideposts on appropriate policy, the FOMC routinely looks at monetary policy rules that recommend a level for the federal funds rate based on the current rates of inflation and unemployment. The July Monetary Policy Report gives an update on monetary policy rules and their role in our policy discussions. I continue to find these rules helpful, although using them requires careful judgment.\\nThank you.

In my remarks today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nSince my appearance before this Committee last June, the economy has continued to make progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In the labor market, job gains averaged 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016, and the number of jobs rose an additional 227,000 in January. Those gains bring the total increase in employment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million. In addition, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it stood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. A broader measure of labor underutilization, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and people who are working part time but would like a full-time job, has also continued to improve over the past year. In addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years ago, a further indication that the job market is tightening. Importantly, improvements in the labor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment rates for all major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics. Even so, it is discouraging that jobless rates for those minorities remain significantly higher than the rate for the nation overall.\\nOngoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen 1.9 percent last year, the same as in 2015. Consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy pace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households' financial assets and homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates. Last year's sales of automobiles and light trucks were the highest annual total on record. In contrast, business investment was relatively soft for much of last year, though it posted some larger gains toward the end of the year in part reflecting an apparent end to the sharp declines in spending on drilling and mining structures; moreover, business sentiment has noticeably improved in the past few months. In addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have restrained manufacturing output. Meanwhile, housing construction has continued to trend up at only a modest pace in recent quarters. And, while the lean stock of homes for sale and ongoing labor market gains should provide some support to housing construction going forward, the recent increases in mortgage rates may impart some restraint.\\nInflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. Total consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in December, still below the FOMC's 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in 2015. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to about 1-3/4 percent.\\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that U.S. monetary policy remains accommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. Of course, our inflation outlook also depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain reasonably well anchored. It is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter part of 2015 and first half of 2016. Meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months.\\nAs always, considerable uncertainty attends the economic outlook. Among the sources of uncertainty are possible changes in U.S. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity growth, and developments abroad.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nTurning to monetary policy, the FOMC is committed to promoting maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Against the backdrop of headwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that emanated from developments abroad, the Committee maintained an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market and an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. At its December meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made toward the FOMC's dual objectives. The Committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds rate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\\nAt its meeting that concluded early this month, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its employment and inflation objectives. As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee's expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\\nThe Committee's view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even keel--will rise somewhat over time. Current estimates of the neutral rate are well below pre-crisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors. The Committee anticipates that the depressing effect of these factors will diminish somewhat over time, raising the neutral funds rate, albeit to levels that are still low by historical standards.\\nThat said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC's monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\\nFinally, the Committee has continued its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.\\nThank you.

Yellen\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 13, 2017.\\nChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In my remarks today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nSince my appearance before this committee in February, the labor market has continued to strengthen. Job gains have averaged 180,000 per month so far this year, down only slightly from the average in 2016 and still well above the pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Indeed, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1/4 percentage point since the start of the year, and, at 4.4 percent in June, is 5‑1/2 percentage points below its peak in 2010 and modestly below the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' assessments of its longer-run normal level. The labor force participation rate has changed little, on net, this year--another indication of improving conditions in the jobs market, given the demographically driven downward trend in this series. A broader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the labor force and those working part time who would prefer full-time work has also fallen this year and is now nearly as low as it was just before the recession. It is also encouraging that jobless rates have continued to decline for most major demographic groups, including for African Americans and Hispanics. However, as before the recession, unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall.\\nMeanwhile, the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace, on average, so far this year. Although inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent in the first quarter, more-recent indicators suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter. In particular, growth in household spending, which was weak earlier in the year, has picked up in recent months and continues to be supported by job gains, rising household wealth, and favorable consumer sentiment. In addition, business fixed investment has turned up this year after having been soft last year. And a strengthening in economic growth abroad has provided important support for U.S. manufacturing production and exports. The housing market has continued to recover gradually, aided by the ongoing improvement in the labor market and mortgage rates that, although up somewhat from a year ago, remain at relatively low levels.\\nWith regard to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in May, up from about 1 percent a year ago but a little lower than earlier this year. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has also edged down in recent months and was 1.4 percent in May, a couple of tenths below the year-earlier reading. It appears that the recent lower readings on inflation are partly the result of a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices; these reductions will hold 12-month inflation down until they drop out of the calculation. Nevertheless, with inflation continuing to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, the FOMC indicated in its June statement that it intends to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our symmetric inflation goal.\\nLooking ahead, my colleagues on the FOMC and I expect that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to expand at a moderate pace over the next couple of years, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that monetary policy remains accommodative. Ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and, therefore, consumer spending; global economic growth should support further gains in U.S. exports; and favorable financial conditions, coupled with the prospect of continued gains in domestic and foreign spending and the ongoing recovery in drilling activity, should continue to support business investment. These developments should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.\\nOf course, considerable uncertainty always attends the economic outlook. There is, for example, uncertainty about when--and how much--inflation will respond to tightening resource utilization. Possible changes in fiscal and other government policies here in the United States represent another source of uncertainty. In addition, although the prospects for the global economy appear to have improved somewhat this year, a number of our trading partners continue to confront economic challenges. At present, I see roughly equal odds that the U.S. economy's performance will be somewhat stronger or somewhat less strong than we currently project.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nI will now turn to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability, as required by law. Over the first half of 2017, the Committee continued to gradually reduce the amount of monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at both its March and June meetings, bringing the target to a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made--and is expected to continue to make--toward our mandated objectives.\\nThe Committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and stable prices. That expectation is based on our view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level--that is, the level of the federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel. Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance. But because we also anticipate that the factors that are currently holding down the neutral rate will diminish somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion and return inflation to our 2 percent goal. Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.\\nAs I noted earlier, the economic outlook is always subject to considerable uncertainty, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and to their judgments of the associated risks as informed by incoming data. In this regard, as we noted in the FOMC statement last month, inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective and has declined recently; the Committee will be monitoring inflation developments closely in the months ahead.\\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary policy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our mandated objectives. However, such prescriptions cannot be applied in a mechanical way; their use requires careful judgments about the choice and measurement of the inputs into these rules, as well as the implications of the many considerations these rules do not take into account. I would like to note the discussion of simple monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal Reserve's policy process that appears in our current Monetary Policy Report.\\nBalance Sheet Normalization\\r\\nLet me now turn to our balance sheet. Last month the FOMC augmented its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing additional details on the process that we will follow in normalizing the size of our balance sheet. The Committee intends to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments it receives from the securities held in the System Open Market Account. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps. Initially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels to limit the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb. The Committee currently expects that, provided the economy evolves broadly as anticipated, it will likely begin to implement the program this year.\\nOnce we start to reduce our reinvestments, our securities holdings will gradually decline, as will the supply of reserve balances in the banking system. The longer-run normal level of reserve balances will depend on a number of as-yet-unknown factors, including the banking system's future demand for reserves and the Committee's future decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively. The Committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances to a level that is appreciably below recent levels but larger than before the financial crisis.\\nFinally, the Committee affirmed in June that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In other words, we do not intend to use the balance sheet as an active tool for monetary policy in normal times. However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate. More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.\\nThank you.

Yellen\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 11, 2016.\\nChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nSince my appearance before this Committee last July, the economy has made further progress toward the Federal Reserve\\'s objective of maximum employment. And while inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects that inflation will rise to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\\nIn the labor market, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs rose 2.7 million in 2015, and posted a further gain of 150,000 in January of this year. The cumulative increase in employment since its trough in early 2010, is now more than 13 million jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent in January, 0.8 percentage point below its level a year ago and in line with the median of FOMC participants\\' most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level. Other measures of labor market conditions have also shown solid improvement, with noticeable declines over the past year in the number of individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently, and in the number of people who are working part time but would rather work full time. However, these measures remain above the levels seen prior to the recession, suggesting that some slack in labor markets remains. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, there is still room for further sustainable improvement.\\nThe strong gains in the job market last year were accompanied by a continued moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased about 1-3/4 percent in 2015. Over the course of the year, subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar restrained net exports. In the fourth quarter of last year, growth in the gross domestic product is reported to have slowed more sharply, to an annual rate of just 3/4 percent; again, growth was held back by weak net exports as well as by a negative contribution from inventory investment. Although private domestic final demand appears to have slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, it has continued to advance. Household spending has been supported by steady job gains and solid growth in real disposable income--aided in part by the declines in oil prices. One area of particular strength has been purchases of cars and light trucks; sales of these vehicles in 2015, reached their highest level ever. In the drilling and mining sector, lower oil prices have caused companies to slash jobs and sharply cut capital outlays, but in most other sectors, business investment rose over the second half of last year. And homebuilding activity has continued to move up, on balance, although the level of new construction remains well below the longer-run levels implied by demographic trends.\\nFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. Still, ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the growth of real incomes and therefore consumer spending, and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by highly accommodative monetary policies abroad. Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\\nAs is always the case, the economic outlook is uncertain. Foreign economic developments, in particular, pose risks to U.S. economic growth. Most notably, although recent economic indicators do not suggest a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth, declines in the foreign exchange value of the renminbi have intensified uncertainty about China\\'s exchange rate policy and the prospects for its economy. This uncertainty led to increased volatility in global financial markets and, against the background of persistent weakness abroad, exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth. These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn, low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for U.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.\\nOf course, economic growth could also exceed our projections for a number of reasons, including the possibility that low oil prices will boost U.S. economic growth more than we expect. At present, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments, as well as assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation and the balance of risks to the outlook.\\nAs I noted earlier, inflation continues to run below the Committee\\'s 2 percent objective. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased just 1/2 percent over the 12 months of 2015. To a large extent, the low average pace of inflation last year can be traced to the earlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of other imported goods. And, given the recent further declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as the further appreciation of the dollar, the Committee expects inflation to remain low in the near term. However, once oil and import prices stop falling, the downward pressure on domestic inflation from those sources should wane, and as the labor market strengthens further, inflation is expected to rise gradually to 2 percent over the medium term. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee is carefully monitoring actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.\\nOf course, inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation process, and the Committee\\'s confidence in the inflation outlook depends importantly on the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored. It is worth noting, in this regard, that market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down to historically low levels; our analysis suggests that changes in risk and liquidity premiums over the past year and a half contributed significantly to these declines. Some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations are also at the low end of their recent ranges; overall, however, they have been reasonably stable.\\nMonetary Policy \\r\\nTurning to monetary policy, the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Last March, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. In December, the Committee judged that these two criteria had been satisfied and decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to between 1/4 and 1/2 percent. This increase marked the end of a seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero. The Committee did not adjust the target range in January.\\nThe decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee\\'s assessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee\\'s longer-run objective, the FOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are likely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help move inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.\\nIt is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential--is currently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. The low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds--such as limited access to credit for some borrowers, weak growth abroad, and a significant appreciation of the dollar--that have weighed on aggregate demand.\\nOf course, monetary policy is by no means on a preset course. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In doing so, we will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with the attainment of our objectives over time.\\nConsistent with its previous communications, the Federal Reserve used interest on excess reserves (IOER) and overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) operations to move the federal funds rate into the new target range. The adjustment to the IOER rate has been particularly important in raising the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates more generally in an environment of abundant bank reserves. Meanwhile, overnight RRP operations complement the IOER rate by establishing a soft floor on money market interest rates. The IOER rate and the overnight RRP operations allowed the FOMC to control the federal funds rate effectively without having to first shrink its balance sheet by selling a large part of its holdings of longer-term securities. The Committee judged that removing monetary policy accommodation by the traditional approach of raising short-term interest rates is preferable to selling longer-term assets because such sales could be difficult to calibrate and could generate unexpected financial market reactions.\\nThe Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the December statement, the FOMC anticipates continuing this policy \"until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.\" Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and reduce the risk that we might need to return the federal funds rate target to the effective lower bound in response to future adverse shocks.\\nThank you.

In my remarks today, I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\n      Since my last appearance before this Committee in February, the economy has made further progress toward the Federal Reserve's objective of maximum employment. And while inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent objective, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects inflation to rise to that level over the medium term. However, the pace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed more recently, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      In the labor market, the cumulative increase in jobs since its trough in early 2010 has now topped 14 million, while the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak. In addition, as we detail in the Monetary Policy Report, jobless rates have declined for all major demographic groups, including for African Americans and Hispanics. Despite these declines, however, it is troubling that unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median African American household is still well below the median income of other U.S. households.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      During the first quarter of this year, job gains averaged 200,000 per month, just a bit slower than last year's pace. And while the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent over this period, the labor force participation rate moved up noticeably. In April and May, however, the average pace of job gains slowed to only 80,000 per month or about 100,000 per month after adjustment for the effects of a strike. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, but that decline mainly occurred because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work. A broader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work was unchanged in May and remains above its level prior to the recession. Of course, it is important not to overreact to one or two reports, and several other timely indicators of labor market conditions still look favorable. One notable development is that there are some tentative signs that wage growth may finally be picking up. That said, we will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the recent slowing in employment growth is transitory, as we believe it is.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Economic growth has been uneven over recent quarters. U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of only 3/4 percent in the first quarter of this year. Subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar weighed on exports, while the energy sector was hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014; in addition, business investment outside of the energy sector was surprisingly weak. However, the available indicators point to a noticeable step-up in GDP growth in the second quarter. In particular, consumer spending has picked up smartly in recent months, supported by solid growth in real disposable income and the ongoing effects of the increases in household wealth. And housing has continued to recover gradually, aided by income gains and the very low level of mortgage rates.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The recent pickup in household spending, together with underlying conditions that are favorable for growth, lead me to be optimistic that we will see further improvements in the labor market and the economy more broadly over the next few years. Monetary policy remains accommodative; low oil prices and ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and therefore consumer spending; fiscal policy is now a small positive for growth; and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. As a result, the FOMC expects that with gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen further.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Turning to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased just 1 percent over the 12 months ending in April, up noticeably from its pace through much of last year but still well short of the Committee's 2 percent objective. Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices and lower prices for imports. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1-1/2 percent. As the transitory influences holding down inflation fade and the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the medium term. Nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Of course, considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains. The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk--that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue into the future. Vulnerabilities in the global economy also remain. Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. For all of these reasons, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and their implications for domestic economic activity, labor markets, and inflation.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n      I will turn next to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to promote maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Given the economic situation I just described, monetary policy has remained accommodative over the first half of this year to support further improvement in the labor market and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective. Specifically, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent and has kept the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at an elevated level.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The Committee's actions reflect a careful assessment of the appropriate setting for monetary policy, taking into account continuing below-target inflation and the mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth seen this year. Proceeding cautiously in raising the federal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary support to economic growth in place while we assess whether growth is returning to a moderate pace, whether the labor market will strengthen further, and whether inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent objective. Another factor that supports taking a cautious approach in raising the federal funds rate is that the federal funds rate is still near its effective lower bound. If inflation were to remain persistently low or the labor market were to weaken, the Committee would have only limited room to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. However, if the economy were to overheat and inflation seemed likely to move significantly or persistently above 2 percent, the FOMC could readily increase the target range for the federal funds rate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further and that the economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds--which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth--mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards. If these headwinds slowly fade over time, as the Committee expects, then gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be needed. In line with that view, most FOMC participants, based on their projections prepared for the June meeting, anticipate that values for the federal funds rate of less than 1 percent at the end of this year and less than 2 percent at the end of next year will be consistent with their assessment of appropriate monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Of course, the economic outlook is uncertain, so monetary policy is by no means on a preset course and FOMC participants' projections for the federal funds rate are not a predetermined plan for future policy. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and associated risks. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with their attainment over time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the statement released after the June FOMC meeting, we anticipate continuing this policy until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound in the event of a future large adverse shock.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Thank you.

In my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\n       Since my appearance before this Committee last July, the employment situation in the United States has been improving along many dimensions. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.7 percent, down from just over 6 percent last summer and from 10 percent at its peak in late 2009. The average pace of monthly job gains picked up from about 240,000 per month during the first half of last year to 280,000 per month during the second half, and employment rose 260,000 in January. In addition, long-term unemployment has declined substantially, fewer workers are reporting that they can find only part-time work when they would prefer full-time employment, and the pace of quits--often regarded as a barometer of worker confidence in labor market opportunities--has recovered nearly to its pre-recession level. However, the labor force participation rate is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists. In short, considerable progress has been achieved in the recovery of the labor market, though room for further improvement remains.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At the same time that the labor market situation has improved, domestic spending and production have been increasing at a solid rate. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to have increased at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. While GDP growth is not anticipated to be sustained at that pace, it is expected to be strong enough to result in a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Consumer spending has been lifted by the improvement in the labor market as well as by the increase in household purchasing power resulting from the sharp drop in oil prices. However, housing construction continues to lag; activity remains well below levels we judge could be supported in the longer run by population growth and the likely rate of household formation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Despite the overall improvement in the U.S. economy and the U.S. economic outlook, longer-term interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies have moved down significantly since the middle of last year; the declines have reflected, at least in part, disappointing foreign growth and changes in monetary policy abroad. Another notable development has been the plunge in oil prices. The bulk of this decline appears to reflect increased global supply rather than weaker global demand. While the drop in oil prices will have negative effects on energy producers and will probably result in job losses in this sector, causing hardship for affected workers and their families, it will likely be a significant overall plus, on net, for our economy. Primarily, that boost will arise from U.S. households having the wherewithal to increase their spending on other goods and services as they spend less on gasoline.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Foreign economic developments, however, could pose risks to the outlook for U.S. economic growth. Although the pace of growth abroad appears to have stepped up slightly in the second half of last year, foreign economies are confronting a number of challenges that could restrain economic activity. In China, economic growth could slow more than anticipated as policymakers address financial vulnerabilities and manage the desired transition to less reliance on exports and investment as sources of growth. In the euro area, recovery remains slow, and inflation has fallen to very low levels; although highly accommodative monetary policy should help boost economic growth and inflation there, downside risks to economic activity in the region remain. The uncertainty surrounding the foreign outlook, however, does not exclusively reflect downside risks. We could see economic activity respond to the policy stimulus now being provided by foreign central banks more strongly than we currently anticipate, and the recent decline in world oil prices could boost overall global economic growth more than we expect.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       U.S. inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective. In large part, the recent softness in the all-items measure of inflation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) reflects the drop in oil prices. Indeed, the PCE price index edged down during the fourth quarter of last year and looks to be on track to register a more significant decline this quarter because of falling consumer energy prices. But core PCE inflation has also slowed since last summer, in part reflecting declines in the prices of many imported items and perhaps also some pass-through of lower energy costs into core consumer prices.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Despite the very low recent readings on actual inflation, inflation expectations as measured in a range of surveys of households and professional forecasters have thus far remained stable. However, inflation compensation, as calculated from the yields of real and nominal Treasury securities, has declined. As best we can tell, the fall in inflation compensation mainly reflects factors other than a reduction in longer-term inflation expectations. The Committee expects inflation to decline further in the near term before rising gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate, but we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n       I will now turn to monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our mandate from the Congress. As my description of economic developments indicated, our economy has made important progress toward the objective of maximum employment, reflecting in part support from the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in recent years. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions--the stated objective of the Committee's recent asset purchase program--the FOMC concluded that program at the end of October.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Even so, the Committee judges that a high degree of policy accommodation remains appropriate to foster further improvement in labor market conditions and to promote a return of inflation toward 2 percent over the medium term. Accordingly, the FOMC has continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to keep the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The FOMC is also providing forward guidance that offers information about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. In that regard, the Committee judged, in December and January, that it can be patient in beginning to raise the federal funds rate. This judgment reflects the fact that inflation continues to run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective, and that room for sustainable improvements in labor market conditions still remains.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The FOMC's assessment that it can be patient in beginning to normalize policy means that the Committee considers it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings. If economic conditions continue to improve, as the Committee anticipates, the Committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Before then, the Committee will change its forward guidance. However, it is important to emphasize that a modification of the forward guidance should not be read as indicating that the Committee will necessarily increase the target range in a couple of meetings. Instead the modification should be understood as reflecting the Committee's judgment that conditions have improved to the point where it will soon be the case that a change in the target range could be warranted at any meeting. Provided that labor market conditions continue to improve and further improvement is expected, the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when, on the basis of incoming data, the Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will move back over the medium term toward our 2 percent objective.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       It continues to be the FOMC's assessment that even after employment and inflation are near levels consistent with our dual mandate, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. It is possible, for example, that it may be necessary for the federal funds rate to run temporarily below its normal longer-run level because the residual effects of the financial crisis may continue to weigh on economic activity. As such factors continue to dissipate, we would expect the federal funds rate to move toward its longer-run normal level. In response to unforeseen developments, the Committee will adjust the target range for the federal funds rate to best promote the achievement of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\\r\\n    \\n\\nPolicy Normalization\\r\\n       Let me now turn to the mechanics of how we intend to normalize the stance and conduct of monetary policy when a decision is eventually made to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Last September, the FOMC issued its statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. This statement provides information about the Committee's likely approach to raising short-term interest rates and reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. As is always the case in setting policy, the Committee will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The FOMC intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily by changing its target range for the federal funds rate and not by actively managing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The Committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so and to maintain reasonable control of the level of short-term interest rates as policy continues to firm thereafter, even though the level of reserves held by depository institutions is likely to diminish only gradually. The primary means of raising the federal funds rate will be to increase the rate of interest paid on excess reserves. The Committee also will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate. As economic and financial conditions evolve, the Committee will phase out these supplementary tools when they are no longer needed.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee intends to reduce its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal from securities held by the Federal Reserve. It is the Committee's intention to hold, in the longer run, no more securities than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy, and that these securities be primarily Treasury securities.\\r\\n    \\n\\nSummary\\r\\n       In sum, since the July 2014 Monetary Policy Report, there has been important progress toward the FOMC's objective of maximum employment. However, despite this improvement, too many Americans remain unemployed or underemployed, wage growth is still sluggish, and inflation remains well below our longer-run objective. As always, the Federal Reserve remains committed to employing its tools to best promote the attainment of its objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you.

Yellen\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 16, 2015.\\n\\r\\n      Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\n      Since my appearance before this Committee in February, the economy has made further progress toward the Federal Reserve's objective of maximum employment, while inflation has continued to run below the level that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges to be most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      In the labor market, the unemployment rate now stands at 5.3 percent, slightly below its level at the end of last year and down more than 4-1/2 percentage points from its 10 percent peak in late 2009. Meanwhile, monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 210,000 over the first half of this year, somewhat less than the robust 260,000 average seen in 2014 but still sufficient to bring the total increase in employment since its trough to more than 12 million jobs. Other measures of job market health are also trending in the right direction, with noticeable declines over the past year in the number of people suffering long-term unemployment and in the numbers working part time who would prefer full-time employment. However, these measures--as well as the unemployment rate--continue to indicate that there is still some slack in labor markets. For example, too many people are not searching for a job but would likely do so if the labor market was stronger. And, although there are tentative signs that wage growth has picked up, it continues to be relatively subdued, consistent with other indications of slack. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, they are, in the FOMC's judgment, not yet consistent with maximum employment.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Even as the labor market was improving, domestic spending and production softened notably during the first half of this year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to have been little changed in the first quarter after having risen at an average annual rate of 3-1/2 percent over the second half of last year, and industrial production has declined a bit, on balance, since the turn of the year. While these developments bear watching, some of this sluggishness seems to be the result of transitory factors, including unusually severe winter weather, labor disruptions at West Coast ports, and statistical noise. The available data suggest a moderate pace of GDP growth in the second quarter as these influences dissipate. Notably, consumer spending has picked up, and sales of motor vehicles in May and June were strong, suggesting that many households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase big-ticket items. In addition, homebuilding has picked up somewhat lately, although the demand for housing is still being restrained by limited availability of mortgage loans to many potential homebuyers. Business investment has been soft this year, partly reflecting the plunge in oil drilling. And net exports are being held down by weak economic growth in several of our major trading partners and the appreciation of the dollar.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Looking forward, prospects are favorable for further improvement in the U.S. labor market and the economy more broadly. Low oil prices and ongoing employment gains should continue to bolster consumer spending, financial conditions generally remain supportive of growth, and the highly accommodative monetary policies abroad should work to strengthen global growth. In addition, some of the headwinds restraining economic growth, including the effects of dollar appreciation on net exports and the effect of lower oil prices on capital spending, should diminish over time. As a result, the FOMC expects U.S. GDP growth to strengthen over the remainder of this year and the unemployment rate to decline gradually.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      As always, however, there are some uncertainties in the economic outlook. Foreign developments, in particular, pose some risks to U.S. growth. Most notably, although the recovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece remains difficult. And China continues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property markets, and volatile financial conditions. But economic growth abroad could also pick up more quickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for U.S. economic activity. The U.S. economy also might snap back more quickly as the transitory influences holding down first-half growth fade and the boost to consumer spending from low oil prices shows through more definitively.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      As I noted earlier, inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index up only 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in May and the core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, up only 1-1/4 percent over the same period. To a significant extent, the recent low readings on total PCE inflation reflect influences that are likely to be transitory, particularly the earlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of non-energy imported goods. Indeed, energy prices appear to have stabilized recently.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Although monthly inflation readings have firmed lately, the 12-month change in the PCE price index is likely to remain near its recent low level in the near term. My colleagues and I continue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market improves further, inflation will move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low--although they have risen some from their levels earlier this year--and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Committee will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n      Regarding monetary policy, the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Given the economic situation that I just described, the Committee has judged that a high degree of monetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have kept the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      In its most recent statement, the FOMC again noted that it judged it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee will determine the timing of the initial increase in the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on its assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. Indeed, most participants in June projected that an increase in the federal funds target range would likely become appropriate before year-end. But let me emphasize again that these are projections based on the anticipated path of the economy, not statements of intent to raise rates at any particular time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      A decision by the Committee to raise its target range for the federal funds rate will signal how much progress the economy has made in healing from the trauma of the financial crisis. That said, the importance of the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target should not be overemphasized. What matters for financial conditions and the broader economy is the entire expected path of interest rates, not any particular move, including the initial increase, in the federal funds rate. Indeed, the stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the first increase in the federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In the projections prepared for our June meeting, most FOMC participants anticipated that economic conditions would evolve over time in a way that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate as the headwinds that still restrain real activity continue to diminish and inflation rises. Of course, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a higher and steeper trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep than currently projected. As always, we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining the Committee's dual mandate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      I would also like to note that the Federal Reserve has continued to refine its operational plans pertaining to the deployment of our various policy tools when the Committee judges it appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of policy. Last fall, the Committee issued a detailed statement concerning its plans for policy normalization and, over the past few months, we have announced a number of additional details regarding the approach the Committee intends to use when it decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\\r\\n    \\n\\nFederal Reserve Transparency and Accountability\\r\\n      These statements pertaining to policy normalization constitute recent examples of the many steps the Federal Reserve has taken over the years to improve our public communications concerning monetary policy. As this Committee well knows, the Board has for many years delivered an extensive report on monetary policy and economic developments at semiannual hearings such as this one. And the FOMC has long announced its monetary policy decisions by issuing statements shortly after its meetings, followed by minutes of its meetings with a full account of policy discussions and, with an appropriate lag, complete meeting transcripts. Innovations in recent years have included quarterly press conferences and the quarterly release of FOMC participants' projections for economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and the appropriate path for the Committee's interest rate target. In addition, the Committee adopted a statement in 2012 concerning its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that included a specific 2 percent longer-run objective for inflation and a commitment to follow a balanced approach in pursuing our mandated goals.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Transparency concerning the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy is desirable because better public understanding enhances the effectiveness of policy. More important, however, is that transparent communications reflect the Federal Reserve's commitment to accountability within our democratic system of government. Our various communications tools are important means of implementing monetary policy and have many technical elements. Each step forward in our communications practices has been taken with the goal of enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy and avoiding unintended consequences. Effective communication is also crucial to ensuring that the Federal Reserve remains accountable, but measures that affect the ability of policymakers to make decisions about monetary policy free of short-term political pressure, in the name of transparency, should be avoided.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The Federal Reserve ranks among the most transparent central banks. We publish a summary of our balance sheet every week. Our financial statements are audited annually by an outside auditor and made public. Every security we hold is listed on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. And, in conformance with the Dodd-Frank Act, transaction-level data on all of our lending--including the identity of borrowers and the amounts borrowed--are published with a two-year lag. Efforts to further increase transparency, no matter how well intentioned, must avoid unintended consequences that could undermine the Federal Reserve's ability to make policy in the long-run best interest of American families and businesses.\\r\\n    \\n\\nSummary\\r\\n      In sum, since the February 2015 Monetary Policy Report, we have seen, despite the soft patch in economic activity in the first quarter, that the labor market has continued to show progress toward our objective of maximum employment. Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, but we believe transitory factors have played a major role. We continue to anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. As always, the Federal Reserve remains committed to employing its tools to best promote the attainment of its dual mandate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Thank you.

Yellen\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 27, 2014\\n\\r\\n       Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy. I will conclude with an update on our continuing work on regulatory reform.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       First, let me acknowledge the important contributions of Chairman Bernanke. His leadership helped make our economy and financial system stronger and ensured that the Federal Reserve is transparent and accountable. I pledge to continue that work.\\r\\n    \\n\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\n       The economic recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have risen at an average annual rate of more than 3-1/2 percent in the third and fourth quarters, up from a 1-3/4 percent pace in the first half. The pickup in economic activity has fueled further progress in the labor market. About 1-1/4 million jobs have been added to payrolls since the previous Monetary Policy Report last July, and 3-1/4 million have been added since August 2012, the month before the Federal Reserve began a new round of asset purchases to add momentum to the recovery. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly a percentage point since the middle of last year and 1-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the current asset purchase program. Nevertheless, the recovery in the labor market is far from complete. The unemployment rate is still well above levels that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants estimate is consistent with maximum sustainable employment. Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Among the major components of GDP, household and business spending growth stepped up during the second half of last year. Early in 2013, growth in consumer spending was restrained by changes in fiscal policy. As this restraint abated during the second half of the year, household spending accelerated, supported by job gains and by rising home values and equity prices. Similarly, growth in business investment started off slowly last year but then picked up during the second half, reflecting improving sales prospects, greater confidence, and still-favorable financing conditions. In contrast, the recovery in the housing sector slowed in the wake of last year\\'s increase in mortgage rates.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation remained low as the economy picked up strength, with both the headline and core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price indexes rising only about 1 percent last year, well below the FOMC\\'s 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. Some of the recent softness reflects factors that seem likely to prove transitory, including falling prices for crude oil and declines in non-oil import prices.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       My colleagues on the FOMC and I anticipate that economic activity and employment will expand at a moderate pace this year and next, the unemployment rate will continue to decline toward its longer-run sustainable level, and inflation will move back toward 2 percent over coming years. We have been watching closely the recent volatility in global financial markets. Our sense is that at this stage these developments do not pose a substantial risk to the U.S. economic outlook. We will, of course, continue to monitor the situation.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n       Turning to monetary policy, let me emphasize that I expect a great deal of continuity in the FOMC\\'s approach to monetary policy. I served on the Committee as we formulated our current policy strategy and I strongly support that strategy, which is designed to fulfill the Federal Reserve\\'s statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Prior to the financial crisis, the FOMC carried out monetary policy by adjusting its target for the federal funds rate. With that rate near zero since late 2008, we have relied on two less-traditional tools--asset purchases and forward guidance--to help the economy move toward maximum employment and price stability. Both tools put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and support asset prices. In turn, these more accommodative financial conditions support consumer spending, business investment, and housing construction, adding impetus to the recovery.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Our current program of asset purchases began in September 2012 amid signs that the recovery was weakening and progress in the labor market had slowed. The Committee said that it would continue the program until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. In mid-2013, the Committee indicated that if progress toward its objectives continued as expected, a moderation in the monthly pace of purchases would likely become appropriate later in the year. In December, the Committee judged that the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions warranted a modest reduction in the pace of purchases, from $45 billion to $40 billion per month of longer-term Treasury securities and from $40 billion to $35 billion per month of agency mortgage-backed securities. At its January meeting, the Committee decided to make additional reductions of the same magnitude. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee\\'s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. That said, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee\\'s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee has emphasized that a highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after asset purchases end. In addition, the Committee has said since December 2012 that it expects the current low target range for the federal funds rate to be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above our 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Crossing one of these thresholds will not automatically prompt an increase in the federal funds rate, but will instead indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook would justify such an increase. In December of last year and again this January, the Committee said that its current expectation--based on its assessment of a broad range of measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments--is that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the 2 percent goal. I am committed to achieving both parts of our dual mandate: helping the economy return to full employment and returning inflation to 2 percent while ensuring that it does not run persistently above or below that level.\\r\\n    \\n\\nStrengthening the Financial System\\r\\n       I will finish with an update on progress on regulatory reforms and supervisory actions to strengthen the financial system. In October, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule to strengthen the liquidity positions of large and internationally active financial institutions.1 Together with other federal agencies, the Board also issued a final rule implementing the Volcker rule, which prohibits banking firms from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain financial instruments.2 On the supervisory front, the next round of annual capital stress tests of the largest 30 bank holding companies is under way, and we expect to report results in March.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Regulatory and supervisory actions, including those that are leading to substantial increases in capital and liquidity in the banking sector, are making our financial system more resilient. Still, important tasks lie ahead. In the near term, we expect to finalize the rules implementing enhanced prudential standards mandated by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We also are working to finalize the proposed rule strengthening the leverage ratio standards for U.S.-based, systemically important global banks. We expect to issue proposals for a risk-based capital surcharge for those banks as well as for a long-term debt requirement to help ensure that these organizations can be resolved. In addition, we are working to advance proposals on margins for noncleared derivatives, consistent with a new global framework, and are evaluating possible measures to address financial stability risks associated with short-term wholesale funding. We will continue to monitor for emerging risks, including watching carefully to see if the regulatory reforms work as intended.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Since the financial crisis and the depths of the recession, substantial progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Still, there is more to do. Too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and the work of making the financial system more robust has not yet been completed. I look forward to working with my colleagues and many others to carry out the important mission you have given the Federal Reserve.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       \\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n1.

Yellen\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 16, 2014.\\n\\r\\n       Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy. I will conclude with a few words about financial stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\n       The economy is continuing to make progress toward the Federal Reserve\\'s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the labor market, gains in total nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 230,000 per month over the first half of this year, a somewhat stronger pace than in 2013 and enough to bring the total increase in jobs during the economic recovery thus far to more than 9 million. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1-1/2 percentage points over the past year and stood at 6.1 percent in June, down about 4 percentage points from its peak. Broader measures of labor utilization have also registered notable improvements over the past year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have declined sharply in the first quarter. The decline appears to have resulted mostly from transitory factors, and a number of recent indicators of production and spending suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter, but this bears close watching. The housing sector, however, has shown little recent progress. While this sector has recovered notably from its earlier trough, housing activity leveled off in the wake of last year\\'s increase in mortgage rates, and readings this year have, overall, continued to be disappointing.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Although the economy continues to improve, the recovery is not yet complete. Even with the recent declines, the unemployment rate remains above Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants\\' estimates of its longer-run normal level. Labor force participation appears weaker than one would expect based on the aging of the population and the level of unemployment. These and other indications that significant slack remains in labor markets are corroborated by the continued slow pace of growth in most measures of hourly compensation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation has moved up in recent months but remains below the FOMC\\'s 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months through May. Pressures on food and energy prices account for some of the increase in PCE price inflation. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 1.5 percent. Most Committee participants project that both total and core inflation will be between 1-1/2 and 1-3/4 percent for this year as a whole.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Although the decline in GDP in the first quarter led to some downgrading of our growth projections for this year, I and other FOMC participants continue to anticipate that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace over the next several years, supported by accommodative monetary policy, a waning drag from fiscal policy, the lagged effects of higher home prices and equity values, and strengthening foreign growth. The Committee sees the projected pace of economic growth as sufficient to support ongoing improvement in the labor market with further job gains, and the unemployment rate is anticipated to continue to decline toward its longer-run sustainable level. Consistent with the anticipated further recovery in the labor market, and given that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, we expect inflation to move back toward our 2 percent objective over coming years.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As always, considerable uncertainty surrounds our projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. FOMC participants currently judge these risks to be nearly balanced but to warrant monitoring in the months ahead.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\nI will now turn to monetary policy. The FOMC is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our dual mandate from the Congress. Given the economic situation that I just described, we judge that a high degree of monetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have continued to rely on large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate to provide the appropriate level of support for the economy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment that has occurred since the inception of the Federal Reserve\\'s asset purchase program in September 2012 and the FOMC\\'s assessment that labor market conditions would continue to improve, the Committee has made measured reductions in the monthly pace of our asset purchases at each of our regular meetings this year. If incoming data continue to support our expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward 2 percent, the Committee likely will make further measured reductions in the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings, with purchases concluding after the October meeting. Even after the Committee ends these purchases, the Federal Reserve\\'s sizable holdings of longer-term securities will help maintain accommodative financial conditions, thus supporting further progress in returning employment and inflation to mandate-consistent levels.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee is also fostering accommodative financial conditions through forward guidance that provides greater clarity about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. Since March, our postmeeting statements have included a description of the framework that is guiding our monetary policy decisions. Specifically, our decisions are and will be based on an assessment of the progress--both realized and expected--toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Our evaluation will not hinge on one or two factors, but rather will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation and long-term inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Based on its assessment of these factors, in June the Committee reiterated its expectation that the current target range for the federal funds rate likely will be appropriate for a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee\\'s 2 percent longer-run goal and provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored. In addition, we currently anticipate that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels that the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Of course, the outlook for the economy and financial markets is never certain, and now is no exception. Therefore, the Committee\\'s decisions about the path of the federal funds rate remain dependent on our assessment of incoming information and the implications for the economic outlook. If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned. Conversely, if economic performance is disappointing, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than currently anticipated.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee remains confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when the time is right and to achieve the desired level of short-term interest rates thereafter, even with the Federal Reserve\\'s elevated balance sheet. At our meetings this spring, we have been constructively working through the many issues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy. These ongoing discussions are a matter of prudent planning and do not imply any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy. The Committee will continue its discussions in upcoming meetings, and we expect to provide additional information later this year.\\r\\n    \\n\\nFinancial Stability\\nThe Committee recognizes that low interest rates may provide incentives for some investors to \"reach for yield,\" and those actions could increase vulnerabilities in the financial system to adverse events. While prices of real estate, equities, and corporate bonds have risen appreciably and valuation metrics have increased, they remain generally in line with historical norms. In some sectors, such as lower-rated corporate debt, valuations appear stretched and issuance has been brisk. Accordingly, we are closely monitoring developments in the leveraged loan market and are working to enhance the effectiveness of our supervisory guidance. More broadly, the financial sector has continued to become more resilient, as banks have continued to boost their capital and liquidity positions, and growth in wholesale short-term funding in financial markets has been modest.\\r\\n    \\n\\nSummary\\r\\n       In sum, since the February Monetary Policy Report, further important progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Yet too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and not all of the necessary financial reform initiatives have been completed. The Federal Reserve remains committed to employing all of its resources and tools to achieve its macroeconomic objectives and to foster a stronger and more resilient financial system.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you.

I will begin with a short summary of current economic conditions and then discuss aspects of monetary and fiscal policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\nCurrent Economic Conditions\\r\\n       Since I last reported to this Committee in mid-2012, economic activity in the United States has continued to expand at a moderate if somewhat uneven pace. In particular, real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter but to have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter.1 The pause in real GDP growth last quarter does not appear to reflect a stalling-out of the recovery. Rather, economic activity was temporarily restrained by weather-related disruptions and by transitory declines in a few volatile categories of spending, even as demand by U.S. households and businesses continued to expand. Available information suggests that economic growth has picked up again this year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consistent with the moderate pace of economic growth, conditions in the labor market have been improving gradually. Since July, nonfarm payroll employment has increased by 175,000 jobs per month on average, and the unemployment rate declined 0.3 percentage point to 7.9 percent over the same period. Cumulatively, private-sector payrolls have now grown by about 6.1 million jobs since their low point in early 2010, and the unemployment rate has fallen a bit more than 2 percentage points since its cyclical peak in late 2009. Despite these gains, however, the job market remains generally weak, with the unemployment rate well above its longer-run normal level. About 4.7 million of the unemployed have been without a job for six months or more, and millions more would like full-time employment but are able to find only part-time work. High unemployment has substantial costs, including not only the hardship faced by the unemployed and their families, but also the harm done to the vitality and productive potential of our economy as a whole. Lengthy periods of unemployment and underemployment can erode workers\\' skills and attachment to the labor force or prevent young people from gaining skills and experience in the first place--developments that could significantly reduce their productivity and earnings in the longer term. The loss of output and earnings associated with high unemployment also reduces government revenues and increases spending, thereby leading to larger deficits and higher levels of debt.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The recent increase in gasoline prices, which reflects both higher crude oil prices and wider refining margins, is hitting family budgets. However, overall inflation remains low. Over the second half of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent, similar to the rate of increase in the first half of the year. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained in the narrow ranges seen over the past several years. Against this backdrop, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\nWith unemployment well above normal levels and inflation subdued, progress toward the Federal Reserve\\'s mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability has required a highly accommodative monetary policy. Under normal circumstances, policy accommodation would be provided through reductions in the FOMC\\'s target for the federal funds rate--the interest rate on overnight loans between banks. However, as this rate has been close to zero since December 2008, the Federal Reserve has had to use alternative policy tools.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       These alternative tools have fallen into two categories. The first is \"forward guidance\" regarding the FOMC\\'s anticipated path for the federal funds rate. Since longer-term interest rates reflect market expectations for shorter-term rates over time, our guidance influences longer-term rates and thus supports a stronger recovery. The formulation of this guidance has evolved over time. Between August 2011 and December 2012, the Committee used calendar dates to indicate how long it expected economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate. At its December 2012 meeting, the FOMC agreed to shift to providing more explicit guidance on how it expects the policy rate to respond to economic developments. Specifically, the December postmeeting statement indicated that the current exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate \"will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee\\'s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\"2 An advantage of the new formulation, relative to the previous date-based guidance, is that it allows market participants and the public to update their monetary policy expectations more accurately in response to new information about the economic outlook. The new guidance also serves to underscore the Committee\\'s intention to maintain accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with stable prices.3\\n\\n\\r\\n       The second type of nontraditional policy tool employed by the FOMC is large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, which, like our forward guidance, are intended to support economic growth by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has engaged in several rounds of such purchases since late 2008. Last September the FOMC announced that it would purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month, and in December the Committee stated that, in addition, beginning in January it would purchase longer-term Treasury securities at an initial pace of $45 billion per month.4 These additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities replace the purchases we were conducting under our now-completed maturity extension program, which lengthened the maturity of our securities portfolio without increasing its size. The FOMC has indicated that it will continue purchases until it observes a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee also stated that in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, it will take appropriate account of their likely efficacy and costs. In other words, as with all of its policy decisions, the Committee continues to assess its program of asset purchases within a cost-benefit framework. In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases, and of policy accommodation more generally, are clear: Monetary policy is providing important support to the recovery while keeping inflation close to the FOMC\\'s 2 percent objective. Notably, keeping longer-term interest rates low has helped spark recovery in the housing market and led to increased sales and production of automobiles and other durable goods. By raising employment and household wealth--for example, through higher home prices‑‑these developments have in turn supported consumer sentiment and spending.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Highly accommodative monetary policy also has several potential costs and risks, which the Committee is monitoring closely. For example, if further expansion of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet were to undermine public confidence in our ability to exit smoothly from our accommodative policies at the appropriate time, inflation expectations could rise, putting the FOMC\\'s price-stability objective at risk. However, the Committee remains confident that it has the tools necessary to tighten monetary policy when the time comes to do so. As I noted, inflation is currently subdued, and inflation expectations appear well anchored; neither the FOMC nor private forecasters are projecting the development of significant inflation pressures.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Another potential cost that the Committee takes very seriously is the possibility that very low interest rates, if maintained for a considerable time, could impair financial stability. For example, portfolio managers dissatisfied with low returns may \"reach for yield\" by taking on more credit risk, duration risk, or leverage. On the other hand, some risk-taking--such as when an entrepreneur takes out a loan to start a new business or an existing firm expands capacity--is a necessary element of a healthy economic recovery. Moreover, although accommodative monetary policies may increase certain types of risk-taking, in the present circumstances they also serve in some ways to reduce risk in the system, most importantly by strengthening the overall economy, but also by encouraging firms to rely more on longer-term funding, and by reducing debt service costs for households and businesses. In any case, the Federal Reserve is responding actively to financial stability concerns through substantially expanded monitoring of emerging risks in the financial system, an approach to the supervision of financial firms that takes a more systemic perspective, and the ongoing implementation of reforms to make the financial system more transparent and resilient. Although a long period of low rates could encourage excessive risk-taking, and continued close attention to such developments is certainly warranted, to this point we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more-rapid job creation.5\\n\\n\\r\\n       Another aspect of the Federal Reserve\\'s policies that has been discussed is their implications for the federal budget. The Federal Reserve earns substantial interest on the assets it holds in its portfolio, and, other than the amount needed to fund our cost of operations, all net income is remitted to the Treasury. With the expansion of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet, yearly remittances have roughly tripled in recent years, with payments to the Treasury totaling approximately $290 billion between 2009 and 2012.6 However, if the economy continues to strengthen, as we anticipate, and policy accommodation is accordingly reduced, these remittances would likely decline in coming years. Federal Reserve analysis shows that remittances to the Treasury could be quite low for a time in some scenarios, particularly if interest rates were to rise quickly.7 However, even in such scenarios, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by the Federal Reserve\\'s purchases will remain higher than the pre-crisis norm, perhaps substantially so. Moreover, to the extent that monetary policy promotes growth and job creation, the resulting reduction in the federal deficit would dwarf any variation in the Federal Reserve\\'s remittances to the Treasury.\\r\\n    \\n\\nThoughts on Fiscal Policy\\nAlthough monetary policy is working to promote a more robust recovery, it cannot carry the entire burden of ensuring a speedier return to economic health. The economy\\'s performance both over the near term and in the longer run will depend importantly on the course of fiscal policy. The challenge for the Congress and the Administration is to put the federal budget on a sustainable long-run path that promotes economic growth and stability without unnecessarily impeding the current recovery.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Significant progress has been made recently toward reducing the federal budget deficit over the next few years. The projections released earlier this month by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that, under current law, the federal deficit will narrow from 7 percent of GDP last year to 2-1/2 percent in fiscal year 2015.8 As a result, the federal debt held by the public (including that held by the Federal Reserve) is projected to remain roughly 75 percent of GDP through much of the current decade.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       However, a substantial portion of the recent progress in lowering the deficit has been concentrated in near-term budget changes, which, taken together, could create a significant headwind for the economic recovery. The CBO estimates that deficit-reduction policies in current law will slow the pace of real GDP growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points this year, relative to what it would have been otherwise. A significant portion of this effect is related to the automatic spending sequestration that is scheduled to begin on March 1, which, according to the CBO\\'s estimates, will contribute about 0.6 percentage point to the fiscal drag on economic growth this year. Given the still-moderate underlying pace of economic growth, this additional near-term burden on the recovery is significant. Moreover, besides having adverse effects on jobs and incomes, a slower recovery would lead to less actual deficit reduction in the short run for any given set of fiscal actions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At the same time, and despite progress in reducing near-term budget deficits, the difficult process of addressing longer-term fiscal imbalances has only begun. Indeed, the CBO projects that the federal deficit and debt as a percentage of GDP will begin rising again in the latter part of this decade, reflecting in large part the aging of the population and fast-rising health-care costs. To promote economic growth in the longer term, and to preserve economic and financial stability, fiscal policymakers will have to put the federal budget on a sustainable long-run path that first stabilizes the ratio of federal debt to GDP and, given the current elevated level of debt, eventually places that ratio on a downward trajectory. Between 1960 and the onset of the financial crisis, federal debt averaged less than 40 percent of GDP. This relatively low level of debt provided the nation much-needed flexibility to meet the economic challenges of the past few years. Replenishing this fiscal capacity will give future Congresses and Administrations greater scope to deal with unforeseen events.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       To address both the near- and longer-term issues, the Congress and the Administration should consider replacing the sharp, frontloaded spending cuts required by the sequestration with policies that reduce the federal deficit more gradually in the near term but more substantially in the longer run. Such an approach could lessen the near-term fiscal headwinds facing the recovery while more effectively addressing the longer-term imbalances in the federal budget.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The sizes of deficits and debt matter, of course, but not all tax and spending programs are created equal with respect to their effects on the economy. To the greatest extent possible, in their efforts to achieve sound public finances, fiscal policymakers should not lose sight of the need for federal tax and spending policies that increase incentives to work and save, encourage investments in workforce skills, advance private capital formation, promote research and development, and provide necessary and productive public infrastructure. Although economic growth alone cannot eliminate federal budget imbalances, in either the short or longer term, a more rapidly expanding economic pie will ease the difficult choices we face.\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n1.

The numerical values for unemployment and inflation included in the guidance are thresholds, not triggers; that is, depending on economic circumstances at the time, the Committee may judge that it is not appropriate to begin raising its target for the federal funds rate as soon as one or both of the thresholds is reached. The 6-1/2 percent threshold for the unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the Committee\\'s longer-term objective for unemployment; because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, the first increase in the target for the funds rate will likely have to occur when the unemployment rate is still above its longer-run normal level. Likewise, the Committee has not altered its longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent, and it neither seeks nor expects a persistent increase in inflation above that target.

Bernanke\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Bernanke presented identical remarks before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate on July 18, 2013.\\n\\r\\n       Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. I will discuss current economic conditions and the outlook and then turn to monetary policy. I\\'ll finish with a short summary of our ongoing work on regulatory reform.\\r\\n    \\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\nThe economic recovery has continued at a moderate pace in recent quarters despite the strong headwinds created by federal fiscal policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Housing has contributed significantly to recent gains in economic activity. Home sales, house prices, and residential construction have moved up over the past year, supported by low mortgage rates and improved confidence in both the housing market and the economy. Rising housing construction and home sales are adding to job growth, and substantial increases in home prices are bolstering household finances and consumer spending while reducing the number of homeowners with underwater mortgages. Housing activity and prices seem likely to continue to recover, notwithstanding the recent increases in mortgage rates, but it will be important to monitor developments in this sector carefully.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Conditions in the labor market are improving gradually. The unemployment rate stood at 7.6 percent in June, about a half percentage point lower than in the months before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) initiated its current asset purchase program in September. Nonfarm payroll employment has increased by an average of about 200,000 jobs per month so far this year. Despite these gains, the jobs situation is far from satisfactory, as the unemployment rate remains well above its longer-run normal level, and rates of underemployment and long-term unemployment are still much too high.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Meanwhile, consumer price inflation has been running below the Committee\\'s longer-run objective of 2 percent. The price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only 1 percent over the year ending in May. This softness reflects in part some factors that are likely to be transitory. Moreover, measures of longer-term inflation expectations have generally remained stable, which should help move inflation back up toward 2 percent. However, the Committee is certainly aware that very low inflation poses risks to economic performance--for example, by raising the real cost of capital investment--and increases the risk of outright deflation. Consequently, we will monitor this situation closely as well, and we will act as needed to ensure that inflation moves back toward our 2 percent objective over time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At the June FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I projected that economic growth would pick up in coming quarters, resulting in gradual progress toward the levels of unemployment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve\\'s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability. Specifically, most participants saw real GDP growth beginning to step up during the second half of this year, eventually reaching a pace between 2.9 and 3.6 percent in 2015. They projected the unemployment rate to decline to between 5.8 and 6.2 percent by the final quarter of 2015. And they saw inflation gradually increasing toward the Committee\\'s 2 percent objective.1\\xa0\\n\\n\\r\\n       The pickup in economic growth projected by most Committee participants partly reflects their view that federal fiscal policy will exert somewhat less drag over time, as the effects of the tax increases and the spending sequestration diminish. The Committee also believes that risks to the economy have diminished since the fall, reflecting some easing of financial stresses in Europe, the gains in housing and labor markets that I mentioned earlier, the better budgetary positions of state and local governments, and stronger household and business balance sheets. That said, the risks remain that tight federal fiscal policy will restrain economic growth over the next few quarters by more than we currently expect, or that the debate concerning other fiscal policy issues, such as the status of the debt ceiling, will evolve in a way that could hamper the recovery. More generally, with the recovery still proceeding at only a moderate pace, the economy remains vulnerable to unanticipated shocks, including the possibility that global economic growth may be slower than currently anticipated.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n       With unemployment still high and declining only gradually, and with inflation running below the Committee\\'s longer-run objective, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for the foreseeable future.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In normal circumstances, the Committee\\'s basic tool for providing monetary accommodation is its target for the federal funds rate. However, the target range for the federal funds rate has been close to zero since late 2008 and cannot be reduced meaningfully further. Instead, we are providing additional policy accommodation through two distinct yet complementary policy tools. The first tool is expanding the Federal Reserve\\'s portfolio of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS); we are currently purchasing $40 billion per month in agency MBS and $45 billion per month in Treasuries. The second tool is \"forward guidance\" about the Committee\\'s plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the medium term.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Within our overall policy framework, we think of these two tools as having somewhat different roles. We are using asset purchases and the resulting expansion of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet primarily to increase the near-term momentum of the economy, with the specific goal of achieving a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. We have made some progress toward this goal, and, with inflation subdued, we intend to continue our purchases until a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook has been realized. In addition, even after purchases end, the Federal Reserve will be holding its stock of Treasury and agency securities off the market and reinvesting the proceeds from maturing securities, which will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We are relying on near-zero short-term interest rates, together with our forward guidance that rates will continue to be exceptionally low--our second tool--to help maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation for an extended period after asset purchases end, even as the economic recovery strengthens and unemployment declines toward more-normal levels. In appropriate combination, these two tools can provide the high level of policy accommodation needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the interest of transparency, Committee participants agreed in June that it would be helpful to lay out more details about our thinking regarding the asset purchase program--specifically, to provide additional information on our assessment of progress to date, as well as of the likely trajectory of the program if the economy evolves as projected. This agreement to provide additional information did not reflect a change in policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee\\'s decisions regarding the asset purchase program (and the overall stance of monetary policy) depend on our assessment of the economic outlook and of the cumulative progress toward our objectives. Of course, economic forecasts must be revised when new information arrives and are thus necessarily provisional. As I noted, the economic outcomes that Committee participants saw as most likely in their June projections involved continuing gains in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the restraint from fiscal policy diminishes. Committee participants also saw inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time. If the incoming data were to be broadly consistent with these projections, we anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year. And if the subsequent data continued to confirm this pattern of ongoing economic improvement and normalizing inflation, we expected to continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending them around midyear. At that point, if the economy had evolved along the lines we anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward our 2 percent objective. Such outcomes would be fully consistent with the goals of the asset purchase program that we established in September.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       I emphasize that, because our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, they are by no means on a preset course. On the one hand, if economic conditions were to improve faster than expected, and inflation appeared to be rising decisively back toward our objective, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly. On the other hand, if the outlook for employment were to become relatively less favorable, if inflation did not appear to be moving back toward 2 percent, or if financial conditions--which have tightened recently--were judged to be insufficiently accommodative to allow us to attain our mandated objectives, the current pace of purchases could be maintained for longer. Indeed, if needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I noted, the second tool the Committee is using to support the recovery is forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate. The Committee has said it intends to maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee anticipates that its current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6‑1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the sense described in the FOMC\\'s statement.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I have observed on several occasions, the phrase \"at least as long as\" is a key component of the policy rate guidance. These words indicate that the specific numbers for unemployment and inflation in the guidance are thresholds, not triggers. Reaching one of the thresholds would not automatically result in an increase in the federal funds rate target; rather, it would lead the Committee to consider whether the outlook for the labor market, inflation, and the broader economy justified such an increase. For example, if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment, the Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6-1/2 percent as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate. Likewise, the Committee would be unlikely to raise the funds rate if inflation remained persistently below our longer-run objective. Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer-run objective, and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual.\\r\\n    \\n\\nRegulatory Reform\\nI will finish by providing you with a brief update on progress on reforms to reduce the systemic risk of the largest financial firms. As Governor Tarullo discussed in his testimony last week before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, the Federal Reserve, with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a final rule earlier this month to implement the Basel III capital reforms.2 The final rule increases the quantity and quality of required regulatory capital by establishing a new minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio and implementing a capital conservation buffer. The rule also contains a supplementary leverage ratio and a countercyclical capital buffer that apply only to large and internationally active banking organizations, consistent with their systemic importance. In addition, the Federal Reserve will propose capital surcharges on firms that pose the greatest systemic risk and will issue a proposal to implement the Basel III quantitative liquidity requirements as they are phased in over the next few years. The Federal Reserve is considering further measures to strengthen the capital positions of large, internationally active banks, including the proposed rule issued last week that would increase the required leverage ratios for such firms.3\\xa0\\n\\n\\r\\n       The Fed also is working to finalize the enhanced prudential standards set out in sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among these standards, rules relating to stress testing and resolution planning already are in place, and we have been actively engaged in stress tests and reviewing the \"first-wave\" resolution plans. In coordination with other agencies, we have made significant progress on the key substantive issues relating to the Volcker rule and are hoping to complete it by year-end.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Finally, the Federal Reserve is preparing to regulate and supervise systemically important nonbank financial firms. Last week, the Financial Stability Oversight Council designated two nonbank financial firms; it has proposed the designation of a third firm, which has requested a hearing before the council.4 We are developing a supervisory and regulatory framework that can be tailored to each firm\\'s business mix, risk profile, and systemic footprint, consistent with the Collins amendment and other legal requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n1. These projections reflect FOMC participants\\' assessments based on their individual judgments regarding appropriate monetary policy.

I will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions and the outlook and then turn to monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\r\\n       The recovery of the U.S. economy continues, but the pace of expansion has been uneven and modest by historical standards. After minimal gains in the first half of last year, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2-1/4 percent annual rate in the second half.1 The limited information available for 2012 is consistent with growth proceeding, in coming quarters, at a pace close to or somewhat above the pace that was registered during the second half of last year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We have seen some positive developments in the labor market. Private payroll employment has increased by 165,000 jobs per month on average since the middle of last year, and nearly 260,000 new private-sector jobs were added in January. The job gains in recent months have been relatively widespread across industries. In the public sector, by contrast, layoffs by state and local governments have continued. The unemployment rate hovered around 9 percent for much of last year but has moved down appreciably since September, reaching 8.3 percent in January. New claims for unemployment insurance benefits have also moderated.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The decline in the unemployment rate over the past year has been somewhat more rapid than might have been expected, given that the economy appears to have been growing during that time frame at or below its longer-term trend; continued improvement in the job market is likely to require stronger growth in final demand and production. Notwithstanding the better recent data, the job market remains far from normal: The unemployment rate remains elevated, long-term unemployment is still near record levels, and the number of persons working part time for economic reasons is very high.2\\n\\n\\r\\n       Household spending advanced moderately in the second half of last year, boosted by a fourth-quarter surge in motor vehicle purchases that was facilitated by an easing of constraints on supply related to the earthquake in Japan. However, the fundamentals that support spending continue to be weak: Real household income and wealth were flat in 2011, and access to credit remained restricted for many potential borrowers. Consumer sentiment, which dropped sharply last summer, has since rebounded but remains relatively low.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the housing sector, affordability has increased dramatically as a result of the decline in house prices and historically low interest rates on conventional mortgages. Unfortunately, many potential buyers lack the down payment and credit history required to qualify for loans; others are reluctant to buy a house now because of concerns about their income, employment prospects, and the future path of home prices. On the supply side of the market, about 30 percent of recent home sales have consisted of foreclosed or distressed properties, and home vacancy rates remain high, putting downward pressure on house prices. More-positive signs include a pickup in construction in the multifamily sector and recent increases in homebuilder sentiment.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Manufacturing production has increased 15 percent since the trough of the recession and has posted solid gains since the middle of last year, supported by the recovery in motor vehicle supply chains and ongoing increases in business investment and exports. Real business spending for equipment and software rose at an annual rate of about 12 percent over the second half of 2011, a bit faster than in the first half of the year. But real export growth, while remaining solid, slowed somewhat over the same period as foreign economic activity decelerated, particularly in Europe.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The members of the Board and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks recently projected that economic activity in 2012 will expand at or somewhat above the pace registered in the second half of last year. Specifically, their projections for growth in real GDP this year, provided in conjunction with the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent.3 These forecasts were considerably lower than the projections they made last June.4 A number of factors have played a role in this reassessment. First, the annual revisions to the national income and product accounts released last summer indicated that the recovery had been somewhat slower than previously estimated. In addition, fiscal and financial strains in Europe have weighed on financial conditions and global economic growth, and problems in U.S. housing and mortgage markets have continued to hold down not only construction and related industries, but also household wealth and confidence. Looking beyond 2012, FOMC participants expect that economic activity will pick up gradually as these headwinds fade, supported by a continuation of the highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       With output growth in 2012 projected to remain close to its longer-run trend, participants did not anticipate further substantial declines in the unemployment rate over the course of this year. Looking beyond this year, FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down only slowly toward levels consistent with the Committee\\'s statutory mandate. In light of the somewhat different signals received recently from the labor market than from indicators of final demand and production, however, it will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess the underlying pace of economic recovery.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At our January meeting, participants agreed that strains in global financial markets posed significant downside risks to the economic outlook. Investors\\' concerns about fiscal deficits and the levels of government debt in a number of European countries have led to substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs, stresses in the European banking system, and associated reductions in the availability of credit and economic activity in the euro area. To help prevent strains in Europe from spilling over to the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve in November agreed to extend and to modify the terms of its swap lines with other major central banks, and it continues to monitor the European exposures of U.S. financial institutions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       A number of constructive policy actions have been taken of late in Europe, including the European Central Bank\\'s program to extend three-year collateralized loans to European financial institutions. Most recently, European policymakers agreed on a new package of measures for Greece, which combines additional official-sector loans with a sizable reduction of Greek debt held by the private sector. However, critical fiscal and financial challenges remain for the euro zone, the resolution of which will require concerted action on the part of European authorities. Further steps will also be required to boost growth and competitiveness in a number of countries. We are in frequent contact with our counterparts in Europe and will continue to follow the situation closely.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I discussed in my July testimony, inflation picked up during the early part of 2011.5 A surge in the prices of oil and other commodities, along with supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan that put upward pressure on motor vehicle prices, pushed overall inflation to an annual rate of more than 3 percent over the first half of last year.6 As we had expected, however, these factors proved transitory, and inflation moderated to an annual rate of 1‑1/2 percent during the second half of the year--close to its average pace in the preceding two years. In the projections made in January, the Committee anticipated that, over coming quarters, inflation will run at or below the 2 percent level we judge most consistent with our statutory mandate. Specifically, the central tendency of participants\\' forecasts for inflation in 2012 ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 percent, about unchanged from the projections made last June.7 Looking farther ahead, participants expected the subdued level of inflation to persist beyond this year. Since these projections were made, gasoline prices have moved up, primarily reflecting higher global oil prices--a development that is likely to push up inflation temporarily while reducing consumers\\' purchasing power. We will continue to monitor energy markets carefully. Longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by surveys and financial market indicators, appear consistent with the view that inflation will remain subdued.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n       Against this backdrop of restrained growth, persistent downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and moderating inflation, the Committee took several steps to provide additional monetary accommodation during the second half of 2011 and early 2012. These steps included changes to the forward rate guidance included in the Committee\\'s post-meeting statements and adjustments to the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of Treasury and agency securities.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The target range for the federal funds rate remains at 0 to 1/4 percent, and the forward guidance language in the FOMC policy statement provides an indication of how long the Committee expects that target range to be appropriate. In August, the Committee clarified the forward guidance language, noting that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through the middle of 2013. By providing a longer time horizon than had previously been expected by the public, the statement tended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. At the January 2012 FOMC meeting, the Committee amended the forward guidance further, extending the horizon over which it expects economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate to at least through late 2014.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to the adjustments made to the forward guidance, the Committee modified its policies regarding the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of securities. In September, the Committee put in place a maturity extension program that combines purchases of longer-term Treasury securities with sales of shorter-term Treasury securities. The objective of this program is to lengthen the average maturity of our securities holdings without generating a significant change in the size of our balance sheet. Removing longer-term securities from the market should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make financial market conditions more supportive of economic growth than they otherwise would have been. To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee also decided at its September meeting to reinvest principal received from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in agency MBS, rather than continuing to reinvest those proceeds in longer-term Treasury securities as had been the practice since August 2010. The Committee reviews the size and composition of its securities holdings regularly and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Before concluding, I would like to say a few words about the statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy that the FOMC issued at the conclusion of its January meeting. The statement reaffirms our commitment to our statutory objectives, given to us by the Congress, of price stability and maximum employment. Its purpose is to provide additional transparency and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. The statement does not imply a change in how the Committee conducts policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Transparency is enhanced by providing greater specificity about our objectives. Because the inflation rate over the longer run is determined primarily by monetary policy, it is feasible and appropriate for the Committee to set a numerical goal for that key variable. The FOMC judges that an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with its statutory mandate. While maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of monetary policy, the maximum level of employment in an economy is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market; it is therefore not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer-run level of employment. However, the Committee can estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inform policy decisions. In our most recent projections in January, for example, FOMC participants\\' estimates of the longer-run, normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.8 As I noted a moment ago, the level of maximum employment in an economy is subject to change; for instance, it can be affected by shifts in the structure of the economy and by a range of economic policies. If at some stage the Committee estimated that the maximum level of employment had increased, for example, we would adjust monetary policy accordingly.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment are generally complementary. Indeed, at present, with the unemployment rate elevated and the inflation outlook subdued, the Committee judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives. However, in cases where these objectives are not complementary, the Committee follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitudes of the deviations of inflation and employment from levels judged to be consistent with the dual mandate, as well as the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to such levels.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n1.

I will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions and the outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\r\\n       The U.S. economy has continued to recover, but economic activity appears to have decelerated somewhat during the first half of this year. After rising at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the second half of 2011, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2012, and available indicators point to a still-smaller gain in the second quarter.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Conditions in the labor market improved during the latter part of 2011 and early this year, with the unemployment rate falling about a percentage point over that period. However, after running at nearly 200,000 per month during the fourth and first quarters, the average increase in payroll employment shrank to 75,000 per month during the second quarter. Issues related to seasonal adjustment and the unusually warm weather this past winter can account for a part, but only a part, of this loss of momentum in job creation. At the same time, the jobless rate has recently leveled out at just over 8 percent.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Household spending has continued to advance, but recent data indicate a somewhat slower rate of growth in the second quarter. Although declines in energy prices are now providing some support to consumers\\' purchasing power, households remain concerned about their employment and income prospects and their overall level of confidence remains relatively low.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We have seen modest signs of improvement in housing. In part because of historically low mortgage rates, both new and existing home sales have been gradually trending upward since last summer, and some measures of house prices have turned up in recent months. Construction has increased, especially in the multifamily sector. Still, a number of factors continue to impede progress in the housing market. On the demand side, many would-be buyers are deterred by worries about their own finances or about the economy more generally. Other prospective homebuyers cannot obtain mortgages due to tight lending standards, impaired creditworthiness, or because their current mortgages are underwater‑‑that is, they owe more than their homes are worth. On the supply side, the large number of vacant homes, boosted by the ongoing inflow of foreclosed properties, continues to divert demand from new construction.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       After posting strong gains over the second half of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, manufacturing production has slowed in recent months. Similarly, the rise in real business spending on equipment and software appears to have decelerated from the double-digit pace seen over the second half of 2011 to a more moderate rate of growth over the first part of this year. Forward-looking indicators of investment demand--such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans--suggest further weakness ahead. In part, slowing growth in production and capital investment appears to reflect economic stresses in Europe, which, together with some cooling in the economies of other trading partners, is restraining the demand for U.S. exports.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At the time of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), my colleagues and I projected that, under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, economic growth will likely continue at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually. Specifically, our projections for growth in real GDP prepared for the meeting had a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.4 percent for this year and 2.2 to 2.8 percent for 2013.1 These forecasts are lower than those we made in January, reflecting the generally disappointing tone of the recent incoming data.2 In addition, financial strains associated with the crisis in Europe have increased since earlier in the year, which--as I already noted--are weighing on both global and domestic economic activity. The recovery in the United States continues to be held back by a number of other headwinds, including still-tight borrowing conditions for some businesses and households, and--as I will discuss in more detail shortly--the restraining effects of fiscal policy and fiscal uncertainty. Moreover, although the housing market has shown improvement, the contribution of this sector to the recovery is less than has been typical of previous recoveries. These headwinds should fade over time, allowing the economy to grow somewhat more rapidly and the unemployment rate to decline toward a more normal level. However, given that growth is projected to be not much above the rate needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force, the reduction in the unemployment rate seems likely to be frustratingly slow. Indeed, the central tendency of participants\\' forecasts now has the unemployment rate at 7 percent or higher at the end of 2014.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee made comparatively small changes in June to its projections for inflation. Over the first three months of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate, boosted by a large increase in retail energy prices that in turn reflected the higher cost of crude oil. However, the sharp drop in crude oil prices in the past few months has brought inflation down. In all, the PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent over the first five months of this year, compared with a 2-1/2 percent rise over 2011 as a whole. The central tendency of the Committee\\'s projections is that inflation will be 1.2 to 1.7 percent this year, and at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges to be consistent with its statutory mandate in 2013 and 2014.\\r\\n    \\n\\nRisks to the Outlook\\r\\n       Participants at the June FOMC meeting indicated that they see a higher degree of uncertainty about their forecasts than normal and that the risks to economic growth have increased. I would like to highlight two main sources of risk: The first is the euro-area fiscal and banking crisis; the second is the U.S. fiscal situation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Earlier this year, financial strains in the euro area moderated in response to a number of constructive steps by the European authorities, including the provision of three-year bank financing by the European Central Bank. However, tensions in euro-area financial markets intensified again more recently, reflecting political uncertainties in Greece and news of losses at Spanish banks, which in turn raised questions about Spain\\'s fiscal position and the resilience of the euro-area banking system more broadly. Euro-area authorities have responded by announcing a number of measures, including funding for the recapitalization of Spain\\'s troubled banks, greater flexibility in the use of the European financial backstops (including, potentially, the flexibility to recapitalize banks directly rather than through loans to sovereigns), and movement toward unified supervision of euro-area banks. Even with these announcements, however, Europe\\'s financial markets and economy remain under significant stress, with spillover effects on financial and economic conditions in the rest of the world, including the United States. Moreover, the possibility that the situation in Europe will worsen further remains a significant risk to the outlook.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve remains in close communication with our European counterparts. Although the politics are complex, we believe that the European authorities have both strong incentives and sufficient resources to resolve the crisis. At the same time, we have been focusing on improving the resilience of our financial system to severe shocks, including those that might emanate from Europe. The capital and liquidity positions of U.S. banking institutions have improved substantially in recent years, and we have been working with U.S. financial firms to ensure they are taking steps to manage the risks associated with their exposures to Europe. That said, European developments that resulted in a significant disruption in global financial markets would inevitably pose significant challenges for our financial system and our economy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The second important risk to our recovery, as I mentioned, is the domestic fiscal situation. As is well known, U.S. fiscal policies are on an unsustainable path, and the development of a credible medium-term plan for controlling deficits should be a high priority. At the same time, fiscal decisions should take into account the fragility of the recovery. That recovery could be endangered by the confluence of tax increases and spending reductions that will take effect early next year if no legislative action is taken. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, if the full range of tax increases and spending cuts were allowed to take effect--a scenario widely referred to as the fiscal cliff--a shallow recession would occur early next year and about 1-1/4 million fewer jobs would be created in 2013.3 These estimates do not incorporate the additional negative effects likely to result from public uncertainty about how these matters will be resolved. As you recall, market volatility spiked and confidence fell last summer, in part as a result of the protracted debate about the necessary increase in the debt ceiling. Similar effects could ensue as the debt ceiling and other difficult fiscal issues come into clearer view toward the end of this year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The most effective way that the Congress could help to support the economy right now would be to work to address the nation\\'s fiscal challenges in a way that takes into account both the need for long-run sustainability and the fragility of the recovery. Doing so earlier rather than later would help reduce uncertainty and boost household and business confidence.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n       In view of the weaker economic outlook, subdued projected path for inflation, and significant downside risks to economic growth, the FOMC decided to ease monetary policy at its June meeting by continuing its maturity extension program (or MEP) through the end of this year. The MEP combines sales of short-term Treasury securities with an equivalent amount of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. As a result, it decreases the supply of longer-term Treasury securities available to the public, putting upward pressure on the prices of those securities and downward pressure on their yields, without affecting the overall size of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet. By removing additional longer-term Treasury securities from the market, the Fed\\'s asset purchases also induce private investors to acquire other longer-term assets, such as corporate bonds and mortgage backed-securities, helping to raise their prices and lower their yields and thereby making broader financial conditions more accommodative.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Economic growth is also being supported by the exceptionally low level of the target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent and the Committee\\'s forward guidance regarding the anticipated path of the funds rate. As I reported in my February testimony, the FOMC extended its forward guidance at its January meeting, noting that it expects that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee has maintained this conditional forward guidance at its subsequent meetings. Reflecting its concerns about the slow pace of progress in reducing unemployment and the downside risks to the economic outlook, the Committee made clear at its June meeting that it is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n1.

Bernanke\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Bernanke presented identical remarks before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on March 2, 2011\\nChairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. I will begin with a discussion of economic conditions and the outlook before turning to monetary policy.\\nThe Economic Outlook\\r\\nFollowing the stabilization of economic activity in mid-2009, the U.S. economy is now in its seventh quarter of growth; last quarter, for the first time in this expansion, our nation\\'s real gross domestic product (GDP) matched its pre-crisis peak. Nevertheless, job growth remains relatively weak and the unemployment rate is still high.\\nIn its early stages, the economic recovery was largely attributable to the stabilization of the financial system, the effects of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and a strong boost to production from businesses rebuilding their depleted inventories. Economic growth slowed significantly in the spring and early summer of 2010, as the impetus from inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as Europe\\'s debt problems roiled global financial markets. More recently, however, we have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold. Notably, real consumer spending has grown at a solid pace since last fall, and business investment in new equipment and software has continued to expand. Stronger demand, both domestic and foreign, has supported steady gains in U.S. manufacturing output.\\nThe combination of rising household and business confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and improving credit conditions seems likely to lead to a somewhat more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year. The most recent economic projections by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents, prepared in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in late January, are for real GDP to increase 3-1/2 to 4 percent in 2011, about one-half percentage point higher than our projections made in November.1 Private forecasters\\' projections for 2011 are broadly consistent with those of the FOMC participants and have also moved up in recent months.2\\xa0\\nWhile indicators of spending and production have been encouraging on balance, the job market has improved only slowly. Following the loss of about 8-3/4 million jobs from early 2008 through 2009, private-sector employment expanded by only a little more than 1 million during 2010, a gain barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates and other entrants to the labor force. We do see some grounds for optimism about the job market over the next few quarters, including notable declines in the unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new claims for unemployment insurance, and an improvement in firms\\' hiring plans. Even so, if the rate of economic growth remains moderate, as projected, it could be several years before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level. Indeed, FOMC participants generally see the unemployment rate still in the range of 7-1/2 to 8 percent at the end of 2012. Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.\\nLikewise, the housing sector remains exceptionally weak. The overhang of vacant and foreclosed houses is still weighing heavily on prices of new and existing homes, and sales and construction of new single-family homes remain depressed. Although mortgage rates are low and house prices have reached more affordable levels, many potential homebuyers are still finding mortgages difficult to obtain and remain concerned about possible further declines in home values.\\nInflation has declined, on balance, since the onset of the financial crisis, reflecting high levels of resource slack and stable longer-term inflation expectations. Indeed, over the 12 months ending in January, prices for all of the goods and services consumed by households (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)) increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.5 percent in the year-earlier period. Wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly earnings increasing only 1.9 percent over the year ending in January. In combination with productivity increases, slow wage growth has implied very tight restraint on labor costs per unit of output.\\nFOMC participants see inflation remaining low; most project that overall inflation will be about 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent this year and in the range of 1 to 2 percent next year and in 2013. Private-sector forecasters generally also anticipate subdued inflation over the next few years.3 Measures of medium- and long-term inflation compensation derived from inflation-indexed Treasury bonds appear broadly consistent with these forecasts. Surveys of households suggest that the public\\'s longer-term inflation expectations also remain stable.\\nAlthough overall inflation is low, since summer we have seen significant increases in some highly visible prices, including those of gasoline and other commodities. Notably, in the past few weeks, concerns about unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and the possible effects on global oil supplies have led oil and gasoline prices to rise further. More broadly, the increases in commodity prices in recent months have largely reflected rising global demand for raw materials, particularly in some fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled with constraints on global supply in some cases. Commodity prices have risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar are unlikely to have been an important driver of the increases seen in recent months.\\nThe rate of pass-through from commodity price increases to broad indexes of U.S. consumer prices has been quite low in recent decades, partly reflecting the relatively small weight of materials inputs in total production costs as well as the stability of longer-term inflation expectations. Currently, the cost pressures from higher commodity prices are also being offset by the stability in unit labor costs. Thus, the most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation--an outlook consistent with the projections of both FOMC participants and most private forecasters. That said, sustained rises in the prices of oil or other commodities would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored. We will continue to monitor these developments closely and are prepared to respond as necessary to best support the ongoing recovery in a context of price stability.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nAs I noted earlier, the pace of recovery slowed last spring--to a rate that, if sustained, would have been insufficient to make meaningful progress against unemployment. With job creation stalling, concerns about the sustainability of the recovery increased. At the same time, inflation--already at very low levels--continued to drift downward, and market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower as investors appeared to become more concerned about the possibility of deflation, or falling prices.4\\xa0\\nUnder such conditions, the Federal Reserve would normally ease monetary policy by reducing the target for its short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate. However, the target range for the federal funds rate has been near zero since December 2008, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low target rate for an extended period. Consequently, another means of providing monetary accommodation has been necessary since that time. In particular, over the past two years the Federal Reserve has eased monetary conditions by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on the open market. The largest program of purchases, which lasted from December 2008 through March 2010, appears to have contributed to an improvement in financial conditions and a strengthening of the recovery. Notably, the substantial expansion of the program announced in March 2009 was followed by financial and economic stabilization and a significant pickup in the growth of economic activity in the second half of that year.\\nIn August 2010, in response to the already-mentioned concerns about the sustainability of the recovery and the continuing declines in inflation to very low levels, the FOMC authorized a policy of reinvesting principal payments on our holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into longer-term Treasury securities. By reinvesting agency securities, rather than allowing them to continue to run off as our previous policy had dictated, the FOMC ensured that a high level of monetary accommodation would be maintained. Over subsequent weeks, Federal Reserve officials noted in public remarks that we were considering providing additional monetary accommodation through further asset purchases. In November, the Committee announced that it intended to purchase an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year.\\nLarge-scale purchases of longer-term securities are a less familiar means of providing monetary policy stimulus than reducing the federal funds rate, but the two approaches affect the economy in similar ways. Conventional monetary policy easing works by lowering market expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, reduces the current level of longer-term interest rates and contributes to both lower borrowing costs and higher asset prices. This easing in financial conditions bolsters household and business spending and thus increases economic activity. By comparison, the Federal Reserve\\'s purchases of longer-term securities, by lowering term premiums, put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates. By easing conditions in credit and financial markets, these actions encourage spending by households and businesses through essentially the same channels as conventional monetary policy.\\nA wide range of market indicators supports the view that the Federal Reserve\\'s recent actions have been effective. For example, since August, when we announced our policy of reinvesting principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS and indicated that we were considering more securities purchases, equity prices have risen significantly, volatility in the equity market has fallen, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities has risen to historically more normal levels. Yields on 5- to 10-year nominal Treasury securities initially declined markedly as markets priced in prospective Fed purchases; these yields subsequently rose, however, as investors became more optimistic about economic growth and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases. All of these developments are what one would expect to see when monetary policy becomes more accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means. Interestingly, these market responses are almost identical to those that occurred during the earlier episode of policy easing, notably in the months following our March 2009 announcement. In addition, as I already noted, most forecasters see the economic outlook as having improved since our actions in August; downside risks to the recovery have receded, and the risk of deflation has become negligible. Of course, it is too early to make any firm judgment about how much of the recent improvement in the outlook can be attributed to monetary policy, but these developments are consistent with it having had a beneficial effect.\\nMy colleagues and I continue to regularly review the asset purchase program in light of incoming information, and we will adjust it as needed to promote the achievement of our mandate from the Congress of maximum employment and stable prices. We also continue to plan for the eventual exit from unusually accommodative monetary policies and the normalization of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet. We have all the tools we need to achieve a smooth and effective exit at the appropriate time. Currently, because the Federal Reserve\\'s asset purchases are settled through the banking system, depository institutions hold a very high level of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve. Even if bank reserves remain high, however, our ability to pay interest on reserve balances will allow us to put upward pressure on short-term market interest rates and thus to tighten monetary policy when required. Moreover, we have developed and tested additional tools that will allow us to drain or immobilize bank reserves to the extent needed to tighten the relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates.5 If necessary, the Federal Reserve can also drain reserves by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on the securities it holds or by selling some of those securities in the open market. The FOMC remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and, in particular, to achieving a rate of inflation in the medium term that is consistent with the Federal Reserve\\'s mandate.\\nFederal Reserve Transparency\\r\\nThe Congress established the Federal Reserve, set its monetary policy objectives, and provided it with operational independence to pursue those objectives. The Federal Reserve\\'s operational independence is critical, as it allows the FOMC to make monetary policy decisions based solely on the longer-term needs of the economy, not in response to short-term political pressures. Considerable evidence supports the view that countries with independent central banks enjoy better economic performance over time.6\\xa0\\nHowever, in our democratic society, the Federal Reserve\\'s independence brings with it the obligation to be accountable and transparent. The Congress and the public must have all the information needed to understand our decisions, to be assured of the integrity of our operations, and to be confident that our actions are consistent with the mandate given to us by the Congress.\\nOn matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is one of the most transparent central banks in the world, making available extensive records and materials to explain its policy decisions. For example, beyond the semiannual Monetary Policy Report I am presenting today, the FOMC provides a post-meeting statement, a detailed set of minutes three weeks after each policy meeting, quarterly economic projections together with an accompanying narrative, and, with a five-year lag, a transcript of each meeting and its supporting materials. In addition, FOMC participants often discuss the economy and monetary policy in public forums, and Board members testify frequently before the Congress.\\nIn recent years the Federal Reserve has also substantially increased the information it provides about its operations and its balance sheet. In particular, for some time the Federal Reserve has been voluntarily providing extensive financial and operational information regarding the special credit and liquidity facilities put in place during the financial crisis, including full descriptions of the terms and conditions of each facility; monthly reports on, among other things, the types of collateral posted and the mix of participants using each facility; weekly updates about borrowings and repayments at each facility; and many other details.7 Further, on December 1, as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Reserve Board posted on its public website the details of more than 21,000 individual credit and other transactions conducted to stabilize markets and support the economic recovery during the crisis. This transaction-level information demonstrated the breadth of these operations and the care that was taken to protect the interests of the taxpayer; indeed, despite the scope of these actions, the Federal Reserve has incurred no credit losses to date on any of the programs and expects no credit losses in any of the few programs that still have loans outstanding. Moreover, we are fully confident that independent assessments of these programs will show that they were highly effective in helping to stabilize financial markets, thus strengthening the economy. Overall, the operational effectiveness of the programs was recently supported as part of a comprehensive review of six lending facilities by the Board\\'s independent Office of Inspector General.8 In addition, we have been working closely with the Government Accountability Office, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congressional Oversight Panel, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on reviews of these facilities as well as a range of matters relating to the Federal Reserve\\'s operations and governance. We will continue to seek ways of enhancing our transparency without compromising our ability to conduct policy in the public interest.\\nThank you.

For example, both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (see the first quarter 2011 survey released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on February 11) and the Blue Chip forecasting panel (see the February 10, 2010, issue of Blue Chip Economic Indicators (New York: Aspen Publishers)) now project real GDP growth of about 3‑1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011, about one-half percentage point higher than the corresponding projections made in August. Looking further ahead, most FOMC participants project that economic growth will pick up a bit more in 2012 and 2013, whereas private forecasters tend to see the expansion proceeding fairly steadily over the next few years.

The Survey of Professional Forecasters projects PCE inflation to run at about 1-1/2 percent in 2011 and to subsequently rise gradually to nearly 2 percent by 2013. The corresponding projections from the Survey of Professional Forecasters for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation are about 1-3/4 percent this year and about 2 percent next year and in 2013. Blue Chip forecasts for CPI inflation stand at about 2 percent for both 2011 and 2012. Return to text\\n4. For example, deflation probabilities inferred from prices of certain inflation-indexed bonds increased during this period. Return to text\\n5. These tools include the ability to execute term reverse repurchase agreements with the primary dealers and other counterparties, which drains reserves from the banking system; and the issuance of term deposits to depository institutions, which immobilizes bank reserves for the period of the deposit.

I will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions and the outlook and then turn to monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\n The U.S. economy has continued to recover, but the pace of the expansion so far this year has been modest. After increasing at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the second half of 2010, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at about a 2 percent rate in the first quarter of this year, and incoming data suggest that the pace of recovery remained soft in the spring. At the same time, the unemployment rate, which had appeared to be on a downward trajectory at the turn of the year, has moved back above 9 percent.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In part, the recent weaker-than-expected economic performance appears to have been the result of several factors that are likely to be temporary. Notably, the run-up in prices of energy, especially gasoline, and food has reduced consumer purchasing power. In addition, the supply chain disruptions that occurred following the earthquake in Japan caused U.S. motor vehicle producers to sharply curtail assemblies and limited the availability of some models. Looking forward, however, the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities should ease the pressure on household budgets, and vehicle manufacturers report that they are making significant progress in overcoming the parts shortages and expect to increase production substantially this summer.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In light of these developments, the most recent projections by members of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, prepared in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in late June, reflected their assessment that the pace of the economic recovery will pick up in coming quarters. Specifically, participants\\' projections for the increase in real GDP have a central tendency of 2.7 to 2.9 percent for 2011, inclusive of the weak first half, and 3.3 to 3.7 percent in 2012--projections that, if realized, would constitute a notably better performance than we have seen so far this year.1\\n\\n\\r\\n       FOMC participants continued to see the economic recovery strengthening over the medium term, with the central tendency of their projections for the increase in real GDP picking up to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2013. At the same time, the central tendencies of the projections of real GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 were marked down nearly 1/2 percentage point compared with those reported in April, suggesting that FOMC participants saw at least some part of the first-half slowdown as persisting for a while. Among the headwinds facing the economy are the slow growth in consumer spending, even after accounting for the effects of higher food and energy prices; the continuing depressed condition of the housing sector; still-limited access to credit for some households and small businesses; and fiscal tightening at all levels of government. Consistent with projected growth in real output modestly above its trend rate, FOMC participants expected that, over time, the jobless rate will decline--albeit only slowly--toward its longer-term normal level. The central tendencies of participants\\' forecasts for the unemployment rate were 8.6 to 8.9 percent for the fourth quarter of this year, 7.8 to 8.2 percent at the end of 2012, and 7.0 to 7.5 percent at the end of 2013.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The most recent data attest to the continuing weakness of the labor market: The unemployment rate increased to 9.2 percent in June, and gains in nonfarm payroll employment were below expectations for a second month. To date, of the more than 8-1/2 million jobs lost in the recession, 1-3/4 million have been regained. Of those employed, about 6 percent--8.6 million workers--report that they would like to be working full time but can only obtain part‑time work. Importantly, nearly half of those currently unemployed have been out of work for more than six months, by far the highest ratio in the post-World War II period. Long-term unemployment imposes severe economic hardships on the unemployed and their families, and, by leading to an erosion of skills of those without work, it both impairs their lifetime employment prospects and reduces the productive potential of our economy as a whole.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Much of the slowdown in aggregate demand this year has been centered in the household sector, and the ability and willingness of consumers to spend will be an important determinant of the pace of the recovery in coming quarters. Real disposable personal income over the first five months of 2011 was boosted by the reduction in payroll taxes, but those gains were largely offset by higher prices for gasoline and other commodities. Households report that they have little confidence in the durability of the recovery and about their own income prospects. Moreover, the ongoing weakness in home values is holding down household wealth and weighing on consumer sentiment. On the positive side, household debt burdens are declining, delinquency rates on credit card and auto loans are down significantly, and the number of homeowners missing a mortgage payment for the first time is decreasing. The anticipated pickups in economic activity and job creation, together with the expected easing of price pressures, should bolster real household income, confidence, and spending in the medium run.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Residential construction activity remains at an extremely low level. The demand for homes has been depressed by many of the same factors that have held down consumer spending more generally, including the slowness of the recovery in jobs and income as well as poor consumer sentiment. Mortgage interest rates are near record lows, but access to mortgage credit continues to be constrained. Also, many potential homebuyers remain concerned about buying into a falling market, as weak demand for homes, the substantial backlog of vacant properties for sale, and the high proportion of distressed sales are keeping downward pressure on house prices.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Two bright spots in the recovery have been exports and business investment in equipment and software. Demand for U.S.-made capital goods from both domestic and foreign firms has supported manufacturing production throughout the recovery thus far. Both equipment and software outlays and exports increased solidly in the first quarter, and the data on new orders received by U.S. producers suggest that the trend continued in recent months. Corporate profits have been strong, and larger nonfinancial corporations with access to capital markets have been able to refinance existing debt and lock in funding at lower yields. Borrowing conditions for businesses generally have continued to ease, although, as mentioned, the availability of credit appears to remain relatively limited for some small firms.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation has picked up so far this year. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at an annual rate of more than 4 percent over the first five months of 2011, and 2-1/2 percent on a 12-month basis. Much of the acceleration was the result of higher prices for oil and other commodities and for imported goods. In addition, prices of motor vehicles increased sharply when supplies of new models were curtailed by parts shortages associated with the earthquake in Japan. Most of the recent rise in inflation appears likely to be transitory, and FOMC participants expected inflation to subside in coming quarters to rates at or below the level of 2 percent or a bit less that participants view as consistent with our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. The central tendency of participants\\' forecasts for the rate of increase in the PCE price index was 2.3 to 2.5 percent for 2011 as a whole, which implies a significant slowing of inflation in the second half of the year. In 2012 and 2013, the central tendency of the inflation forecasts was 1.5 to 2.0 percent. Reasons to expect inflation to moderate include the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities, which is already showing through to retail gasoline and food prices; the still-substantial slack in U.S. labor and product markets, which has made it difficult for workers to obtain wage gains and for firms to pass through their higher costs; and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by surveys of households, the forecasts of professional private-sector economists, and financial market indicators.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\n       FOMC members\\' judgments that the pace of the economic recovery over coming quarters will likely remain moderate, that the unemployment rate will consequently decline only gradually, and that inflation will subside are the basis for the Committee\\'s decision to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy. As you know, that policy currently consists of two parts. First, the target range for the federal funds rate remains at 0 to 1/4 percent and, as indicated in the statement released after the June meeting, the Committee expects that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The second component of monetary policy has been to increase the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of longer-term securities, an approach undertaken because the target for the federal funds rate could not be lowered meaningfully further. The Federal Reserve\\'s acquisition of longer-term Treasury securities boosted the prices of such securities and caused longer-term Treasury yields to be lower than they would have been otherwise. In addition, by removing substantial quantities of longer-term Treasury securities from the market, the Fed\\'s purchases induced private investors to acquire other assets that serve as substitutes for Treasury securities in the financial marketplace, such as corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. By this means, the Fed\\'s asset purchase program--like more conventional monetary policy--has served to reduce the yields and increase the prices of those other assets as well. The net result of these actions is lower borrowing costs and easier financial conditions throughout the economy.2 We know from many decades of experience with monetary policy that, when the economy is operating below its potential, easier financial conditions tend to promote more rapid economic growth. Estimates based on a number of recent studies as well as Federal Reserve analyses suggest that, all else being equal, the second round of asset purchases probably lowered longer-term interest rates approximately 10 to 30 basis points.3 Our analysis further indicates that a reduction in longer-term interest rates of this magnitude would be roughly equivalent in terms of its effect on the economy to a 40 to 120 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In June, we completed the planned purchases of $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities that the Committee initiated in November, while continuing to reinvest the proceeds of maturing or redeemed longer-term securities in Treasuries. Although we are no longer expanding our securities holdings, the evidence suggests that the degree of accommodation delivered by the Federal Reserve\\'s securities purchase program is determined primarily by the quantity and mix of securities that the Federal Reserve holds rather than by the current pace of new purchases. Thus, even with the end of net new purchases, maintaining our holdings of these securities should continue to put downward pressure on market interest rates and foster more accommodative financial conditions than would otherwise be the case. It is worth emphasizing that our program involved purchases of securities, not government spending, and, as I will discuss later, when the macroeconomic circumstances call for it, we will unwind those purchases. In the meantime, interest on those securities is remitted to the U.S. Treasury.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       When we began this program, we certainly did not expect it to be a panacea for the country\\'s economic problems. However, as the expansion weakened last summer, developments with respect to both components of our dual mandate implied that additional monetary accommodation was needed. In that context, we believed that the program would both help reduce the risk of deflation that had emerged and provide a needed boost to faltering economic activity and job creation. The experience to date with the round of securities purchases that just ended suggests that the program had the intended effects of reducing the risk of deflation and shoring up economic activity. In the months following the August announcement of our policy of reinvesting maturing and redeemed securities and our signal that we were considering more purchases, inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities rose from low to more normal levels, suggesting that the perceived risks of deflation had receded markedly. This was a significant achievement, as we know from the Japanese experience that protracted deflation can be quite costly in terms of weaker economic growth.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       With respect to employment, our expectations were relatively modest; estimates made in the autumn suggested that the additional purchases could boost employment by about 700,000 jobs over two years, or about 30,000 extra jobs per month.4 Even including the disappointing readings for May and June, which reflected in part the temporary factors discussed earlier, private payroll gains have averaged 160,000 per month in the first half of 2011, compared with average increases of only about 80,000 private jobs per month from May to August 2010. Not all of the step-up in hiring was necessarily the result of the asset purchase program, but the comparison is consistent with our expectations for employment gains. Of course, we will be monitoring developments in the labor market closely.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Once the temporary shocks that have been holding down economic activity pass, we expect to again see the effects of policy accommodation reflected in stronger economic activity and job creation. However, given the range of uncertainties about the strength of the recovery and prospects for inflation over the medium term, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to respond should economic developments indicate that an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       On the one hand, the possibility remains that the recent economic weakness may prove more persistent than expected and that deflationary risks might reemerge, implying a need for additional policy support. Even with the federal funds rate close to zero, we have a number of ways in which we could act to ease financial conditions further. One option would be to provide more explicit guidance about the period over which the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would remain at their current levels. Another approach would be to initiate more securities purchases or to increase the average maturity of our holdings. The Federal Reserve could also reduce the 25 basis point rate of interest it pays to banks on their reserves, thereby putting downward pressure on short-term rates more generally. Of course, our experience with these policies remains relatively limited, and employing them would entail potential risks and costs. However, prudent planning requires that we evaluate the efficacy of these and other potential alternatives for deploying additional stimulus if conditions warrant.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       On the other hand, the economy could evolve in a way that would warrant a move toward less-accommodative policy. Accordingly, the Committee has been giving careful consideration to the elements of its exit strategy, and, as reported in the minutes of the June FOMC meeting, it has reached a broad consensus about the sequence of steps that it expects to follow when the normalization of policy becomes appropriate. In brief, when economic conditions warrant, the Committee would begin the normalization process by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on its securities, thereby allowing the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet to begin shrinking. At the same time or sometime thereafter, the Committee would modify the forward guidance in its statement. Subsequent steps would include the initiation of temporary reserve-draining operations and, when conditions warrant, increases in the federal funds rate target. From that point on, changing the level or range of the federal funds rate target would be our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Sometime after the first increase in the federal funds rate target, the Committee expects to initiate sales of agency securities from its portfolio, with the timing and pace of sales clearly communicated to the public in advance. Once sales begin, the pace of sales is anticipated to be relatively gradual and steady, but it could be adjusted up or down in response to material changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions. Over time, the securities portfolio and the associated quantity of bank reserves are expected to be reduced to the minimum levels consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy. Of course, conditions can change, and in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that process, should that be the next direction for policy, we would carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       \\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n1. Note that these projections do not incorporate the most recent economic news, including last Friday\\'s labor market report. Return to text\\n\\n\\n2. The Federal Reserve\\'s recently completed securities purchase program has changed the average maturity of Treasury securities held by the public only modestly, suggesting that such an effect likely did not contribute substantially to the reduction in Treasury yields. Rather, the more important channel of effect was the removal of Treasury securities from the market, which reduced Treasury yields generally while inducing private investors to hold alternative assets (the portfolio reallocation effect). The substitution into alternative assets raised their prices and lowered their yields, easing overall financial conditions. Return to text\\n\\n\\n3.

I will begin today with some comments on the outlook for the economy and for monetary policy, then touch briefly on several other important issues.\\r\\n    \\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\nAlthough the recession officially began more than two years ago, U.S. economic activity contracted particularly sharply following the intensification of the global financial crisis in the fall of 2008. Concerted efforts by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and other U.S. authorities to stabilize the financial system, together with highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, helped arrest the decline and are supporting a nascent economic recovery. Indeed, the U.S. economy expanded at about a 4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. A significant portion of that growth, however, can be attributed to the progress firms made in working down unwanted inventories of unsold goods, which left them more willing to increase production. As the impetus provided by the inventory cycle is temporary, and as the fiscal support for economic growth likely will diminish later this year, a sustained recovery will depend on continued growth in private-sector final demand for goods and services.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Private final demand does seem to be growing at a moderate pace, buoyed in part by a general improvement in financial conditions. In particular, consumer spending has recently picked up, reflecting gains in real disposable income and household wealth and tentative signs of stabilization in the labor market. Business investment in equipment and software has risen significantly. And international trade--supported by a recovery in the economies of many of our trading partners--is rebounding from its deep contraction of a year ago. However, starts of single-family homes, which rose noticeably this past spring, have recently been roughly flat, and commercial construction is declining sharply, reflecting poor fundamentals and continued difficulty in obtaining financing.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The job market has been hit especially hard by the recession, as employers reacted to sharp sales declines and concerns about credit availability by deeply cutting their workforces in late 2008 and in 2009. Some recent indicators suggest the deterioration in the labor market is abating: Job losses have slowed considerably, and the number of full-time jobs in manufacturing rose modestly in January. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to trend lower, and the temporary services industry, often considered a bellwether for the employment outlook, has been expanding steadily since October. Notwithstanding these positive signs, the job market remains quite weak, with the unemployment rate near 10 percent and job openings scarce. Of particular concern, because of its long-term implications for workers\\' skills and wages, is the increasing incidence of long-term unemployment; indeed, more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or more, nearly double the share of a year ago.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Increases in energy prices resulted in a pickup in consumer price inflation in the second half of last year, but oil prices have flattened out over recent months, and most indicators suggest that inflation likely will be subdued for some time. Slack in labor and product markets has reduced wage and price pressures in most markets, and sharp increases in productivity have further reduced producers\\' unit labor costs. The cost of shelter, which receives a heavy weight in consumer price indexes, is rising very slowly, reflecting high vacancy rates. In addition, according to most measures, longer-term inflation expectations have remained relatively stable.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The improvement in financial markets that began last spring continues. Conditions in short-term funding markets have returned to near pre-crisis levels. Many (mostly larger) firms have been able to issue corporate bonds or new equity and do not seem to be hampered by a lack of credit. In contrast, bank lending continues to contract, reflecting both tightened lending standards and weak demand for credit amid uncertain economic prospects.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In conjunction with the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The contours of these forecasts are broadly similar to those I reported to the Congress last July. FOMC participants continue to anticipate a moderate pace of economic recovery, with economic growth of roughly 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010 and 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in 2011. Consistent with moderate economic growth, participants expect the unemployment rate to decline only slowly, to a range of roughly 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent by the end of 2012, still well above their estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of about 5 percent. Inflation is expected to remain subdued, with consumer prices rising at rates between 1 and 2 percent in 2010 through 2012. In the longer term, inflation is expected to be between 1-3/4 and 2 percent, the range that most FOMC participants judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve\\'s dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\\r\\n    \\n\\nMonetary Policy\\nOver the past year, the Federal Reserve has employed a wide array of tools to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability. The target for the federal funds rate has been maintained at a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent since December 2008. The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. We have been gradually slowing the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipate that these transactions will be completed by the end of March. The FOMC will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In response to the substantial improvements in the functioning of most financial markets, the Federal Reserve is winding down the special liquidity facilities it created during the crisis. On February 1, a number of these facilities, including credit facilities for primary dealers, lending programs intended to help stabilize money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market, and temporary liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks, were allowed to expire.1 The only remaining lending program for multiple borrowers created under the Federal Reserve\\'s emergency authorities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on March 31 for loans backed by all types of collateral except newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and on June 30 for loans backed by newly issued CMBS.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to closing its special facilities, the Federal Reserve is normalizing its lending to commercial banks through the discount window. The final auction of discount-window funds to depositories through the Term Auction Facility, which was created in the early stages of the crisis to improve the liquidity of the banking system, will occur on March 8. Last week we announced that the maximum term of discount window loans, which was increased to as much as 90 days during the crisis, would be returned to overnight for most banks, as it was before the crisis erupted in August 2007. To discourage banks from relying on the discount window rather than private funding markets for short-term credit, last week we also increased the discount rate by 25 basis points, raising the spread between the discount rate and the top of the target range for the federal funds rate to 50 basis points. These changes, like the closure of most of the special lending facilities earlier this month, are in response to the improved functioning of financial markets, which has reduced the need for extraordinary assistance from the Federal Reserve. These adjustments are not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for households and businesses and should not be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy, which remains about the same as it was at the time of the January meeting of the FOMC.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Although the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as the expansion matures, the Federal Reserve will at some point need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding the substantial increase in the size of its balance sheet associated with its purchases of Treasury and agency securities, we are confident that we have the tools we need to firm the stance of monetary policy at the appropriate time.2\\n\\n\\r\\n       Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave statutory authority to the Federal Reserve to pay interest on banks\\' holdings of reserve balances at Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in longer-term interest rates and in financial conditions more generally.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve has also been developing a number of additional tools to reduce the large quantity of reserves held by the banking system, which will improve the Federal Reserve\\'s control of financial conditions by leading to a tighter relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates. Notably, our operational capacity for conducting reverse repurchase agreements, a tool that the Federal Reserve has historically used to absorb reserves from the banking system, is being expanded so that such transactions can be used to absorb large quantities of reserves.3 The Federal Reserve is also currently refining plans for a term deposit facility that could convert a portion of depository institutions\\' holdings of reserve balances into deposits that are less liquid and could not be used to meet reserve requirements.4 In addition, the FOMC has the option of redeeming or selling securities as a means of reducing outstanding bank reserves and applying monetary restraint. Of course, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments. I provided more discussion of these options and possible sequencing in a recent testimony.5\\n\\n\\nFederal Reserve Transparency\\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Congress and the public have all the information needed to understand our decisions and to be assured of the integrity of our operations. Indeed, on matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is already one of the most transparent central banks in the world, providing detailed records and explanations of its decisions. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve also took a number of steps to enhance the transparency of its special credit and liquidity facilities, including the provision of regular, extensive reports to the Congress and the public; and we have worked closely with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on a range of matters relating to these facilities.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       While the emergency credit and liquidity facilities were important tools for implementing monetary policy during the crisis, we understand that the unusual nature of those facilities creates a special obligation to assure the Congress and the public of the integrity of their operation. Accordingly, we would welcome a review by the GAO of the Federal Reserve\\'s management of all facilities created under emergency authorities.6 In particular, we would support legislation authorizing the GAO to audit the operational integrity, collateral policies, use of third-party contractors, accounting, financial reporting, and internal controls of these special credit and liquidity facilities. The Federal Reserve will, of course, cooperate fully and actively in all reviews. We are also prepared to support legislation that would require the release of the identities of the firms that participated in each special facility after an appropriate delay. It is important that the release occur after a lag that is sufficiently long that investors will not view an institution\\'s use of one of the facilities as a possible indication of ongoing financial problems, thereby undermining market confidence in the institution or discouraging use of any future facility that might become necessary to protect the U.S. economy. An appropriate delay would also allow firms adequate time to inform investors through annual reports and other public documents of their use of Federal Reserve facilities.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Looking ahead, we will continue to work with the Congress in identifying approaches for enhancing the Federal Reserve\\'s transparency that are consistent with our statutory objectives of fostering maximum employment and price stability. In particular, it is vital that the conduct of monetary policy continue to be insulated from short-term political pressures so that the FOMC can make policy decisions in the longer-term economic interests of the American people. Moreover, the confidentiality of discount window lending to individual depository institutions must be maintained so that the Federal Reserve continues to have effective ways to provide liquidity to depository institutions under circumstances where other sources of funding are not available. The Federal Reserve\\'s ability to inject liquidity into the financial system is critical for preserving financial stability and for supporting depositories\\' key role in meeting the ongoing credit needs of firms and households.\\r\\n    \\n\\nRegulatory Reform\\nStrengthening our financial regulatory system is essential for the long-term economic stability of the nation. Among the lessons of the crisis are the crucial importance of macroprudential regulation--that is, regulation and supervision aimed at addressing risks to the financial system as a whole--and the need for effective consolidated supervision of every financial institution that is so large or interconnected that its failure could threaten the functioning of the entire financial system.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve strongly supports the Congress\\'s ongoing efforts to achieve comprehensive financial reform. In the meantime, to strengthen the Federal Reserve\\'s oversight of banking organizations, we have been conducting an intensive self-examination of our regulatory and supervisory responsibilities and have been actively implementing improvements. For example, the Federal Reserve has been playing a key role in international efforts to toughen capital and liquidity requirements for financial institutions, particularly systemically critical firms, and we have been taking the lead in ensuring that compensation structures at banking organizations provide appropriate incentives without encouraging excessive risk-taking.7\\n\\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve is also making fundamental changes in its supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, both to improve the effectiveness of consolidated supervision and to incorporate a macroprudential perspective that goes beyond the traditional focus on safety and soundness of individual institutions. We are overhauling our supervisory framework and procedures to improve coordination within our own supervisory staff and with other supervisory agencies and to facilitate more-integrated assessments of risks within each holding company and across groups of companies.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Last spring the Federal Reserve led the successful Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, popularly known as the bank stress tests. An important lesson of that program was that combining on-site bank examinations with a suite of quantitative and analytical tools can greatly improve comparability of the results and better identify potential risks. In that spirit, the Federal Reserve is also in the process of developing an enhanced quantitative surveillance program for large bank holding companies. Supervisory information will be combined with firm-level, market-based indicators and aggregate economic data to provide a more complete picture of the risks facing these institutions and the broader financial system. Making use of the Federal Reserve\\'s unparalleled breadth of expertise, this program will apply a multidisciplinary approach that involves economists, specialists in particular financial markets, payments systems experts, and other professionals, as well as bank supervisors.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The recent crisis has also underscored the extent to which direct involvement in the oversight of banks and bank holding companies contributes to the Federal Reserve\\'s effectiveness in carrying out its responsibilities as a central bank, including the making of monetary policy and the management of the discount window. Most important, as the crisis has once again demonstrated, the Federal Reserve\\'s ability to identify and address diverse and hard-to-predict threats to financial stability depends critically on the information, expertise, and powers that it has by virtue of being both a bank supervisor and a central bank.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve continues to demonstrate its commitment to strengthening consumer protections in the financial services arena. Since the time of the previous Monetary Policy Report in July, the Federal Reserve has proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing consumer mortgage transactions, and we are collaborating with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assess how we might further increase transparency in the mortgage process.8 We have issued rules implementing enhanced consumer protections for credit card accounts and private student loans as well as new rules to ensure that consumers have meaningful opportunities to avoid overdraft fees.9 In addition, the Federal Reserve has implemented an expanded consumer compliance supervision program for nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations.10\\n\\n\\r\\n       More generally, the Federal Reserve is committed to doing all that can be done to ensure that our economy is never again devastated by a financial collapse. We look forward to working with the Congress to develop effective and comprehensive reform of the financial regulatory framework.\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\n1.

The Federal Reserve has recently developed the ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements in the triparty market for repurchase agreements, with primary dealers as counterparties and using Treasury and agency debt securities as collateral, and it is developing the capacity to carry out these transactions with a wider set of counterparties (such as money market mutual funds and the mortgage-related government-sponsored enterprises) and using agency mortgage-backed securities as collateral.

In December the Federal Reserve published a proposal describing a term deposit facility in the Federal Register (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), \"Federal Reserve Board Proposes Amendments to Regulation D That Would Enable the Establishment of a Term Deposit Facility,\" press release, December 28). We are now in the process of analyzing the public comments that have been received.

Bernanke\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Bernanke presented identical remarks before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 22, 2010\\nChairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\nEconomic and Financial Developments\\r\\nThe economic expansion that began in the middle of last year is proceeding at a moderate pace, supported by stimulative monetary and fiscal policies. Although fiscal policy and inventory restocking will likely be providing less impetus to the recovery than they have in recent quarters, rising demand from households and businesses should help sustain growth. In particular, real consumer spending appears to have expanded at about a 2-1/2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year, with purchases of durable goods increasing especially rapidly. However, the housing market remains weak, with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home prices and construction.\\nAn important drag on household spending is the slow recovery in the labor market and the attendant uncertainty about job prospects. After two years of job losses, private payrolls expanded at an average of about 100,000 per month during the first half of this year, a pace insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially. In all likelihood, a significant amount of time will be required to restore the nearly 8-1/2 million jobs that were lost over 2008 and 2009. Moreover, nearly half of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than six months. Long-term unemployment not only imposes exceptional near-term hardships on workers and their families, it also erodes skills and may have long-lasting effects on workers\\' employment and earnings prospects.\\nIn the business sector, investment in equipment and software appears to have increased rapidly in the first half of the year, in part reflecting capital outlays that had been deferred during the downturn and the need of many businesses to replace aging equipment. In contrast, spending on nonresidential structures--weighed down by high vacancy rates and tight credit--has continued to contract, though some indicators suggest that the rate of decline may be slowing. Both U.S. exports and U.S. imports have been expanding, reflecting growth in the global economy and the recovery of world trade. Stronger exports have in turn helped foster growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\\nInflation has remained low. The price index for personal consumption expenditures appears to have risen at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of the year. Although overall inflation has fluctuated, partly reflecting changes in energy prices, by a number of measures underlying inflation has trended down over the past two years. The slack in labor and product markets has damped wage and price pressures, and rapid increases in productivity have further reduced producers\\' unit labor costs.\\nMy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I expect continued moderate growth, a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, and subdued inflation over the next several years. In conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared forecasts of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The forecasts are qualitatively similar to those we released in February and May, although progress in reducing unemployment is now expected to be somewhat slower than we previously projected, and near-term inflation now looks likely to be a little lower. Most FOMC participants expect real GDP growth of 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010, and roughly 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in 2011 and 2012. The unemployment rate is expected to decline to between 7 and 7-1/2 percent by the end of 2012. Most participants viewed uncertainty about the outlook for growth and unemployment as greater than normal, and the majority saw the risks to growth as weighted to the downside. Most participants projected that inflation will average only about 1 percent in 2010 and that it will remain low during 2011 and 2012, with the risks to the inflation outlook roughly balanced.\\nOne factor underlying the Committee\\'s somewhat weaker outlook is that financial conditions--though much improved since the depth of the financial crisis--have become less supportive of economic growth in recent months. Notably, concerns about the ability of Greece and a number of other euro-area countries to manage their sizable budget deficits and high levels of public debt spurred a broad-based withdrawal from risk-taking in global financial markets in the spring, resulting in lower stock prices and wider risk spreads in the United States. In response to these fiscal pressures, European leaders put in place a number of strong measures, including an assistance package for Greece and €500 billion of funding to backstop the near-term financing needs of euro-area countries. To help ease strains in U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve reestablished temporary dollar liquidity swap lines with the ECB and several other major central banks. To date, drawings under the swap lines have been limited, but we believe that the existence of these lines has increased confidence in dollar funding markets, helping to maintain credit availability in our own financial system.\\nLike financial conditions generally, the state of the U.S. banking system has also improved significantly since the worst of the crisis. Loss rates on most types of loans seem to be peaking, and, in the aggregate, bank capital ratios have risen to new highs. However, many banks continue to have a large volume of troubled loans on their books, and bank lending standards remain tight. With credit demand weak and with banks writing down problem credits, bank loans outstanding have continued to contract. Small businesses, which depend importantly on bank credit, have been particularly hard hit. At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to facilitate the flow of funds to creditworthy small businesses. Along with the other supervisory agencies, we issued guidance to banks and examiners emphasizing that lenders should do all they can to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, including small businesses.1 We also have conducted extensive training programs for our bank examiners, with the message that lending to viable small businesses is good for the safety and soundness of our banking system as well as for our economy. We continue to seek feedback from both banks and potential borrowers about credit conditions. For example, over the past six months we have convened more than 40 meetings around the country of lenders, small business representatives, bank examiners, government officials, and other stakeholders to exchange ideas about the challenges faced by small businesses, particularly in obtaining credit. A capstone conference on addressing the credit needs of small businesses was held at the Board of Governors in Washington last week.2 This testimony includes an addendum that summarizes the findings of this effort and possible next steps.\\nFederal Reserve Policy\\r\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s response to the financial crisis and the recession has involved several components. First, in response to the periods of intense illiquidity and dysfunction in financial markets that characterized the crisis, the Federal Reserve undertook a range of measures and set up emergency programs designed to provide liquidity to financial institutions and markets in the form of fully secured, mostly short-term loans. Over time, these programs helped to stem the panic and to restore normal functioning in a number of key financial markets, supporting the flow of credit to the economy. As financial markets stabilized, the Federal Reserve shut down most of these programs during the first half of this year and took steps to normalize the terms on which it lends to depository institutions. The only such programs currently open to provide new liquidity are the recently reestablished dollar liquidity swap lines with major central banks that I noted earlier. Importantly, our broad-based programs achieved their intended purposes with no loss to taxpayers. All of the loans extended through the multiborrower facilities that have come due have been repaid in full, with interest. In addition, the Board does not expect the Federal Reserve to incur a net loss on any of the secured loans provided during the crisis to help prevent the disorderly failure of systemically significant financial institutions.\\nA second major component of the Federal Reserve\\'s response to the financial crisis and recession has involved both standard and less conventional forms of monetary policy. Over the course of the crisis, the FOMC aggressively reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, which has been maintained since the end of 2008. And, as indicated in the statement released after the June meeting, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.3\\nIn addition to the very low federal funds rate, the FOMC has provided monetary policy stimulus through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, federal agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). A range of evidence suggests that these purchases helped improve conditions in mortgage markets and other private credit markets and put downward pressure on longer-term private borrowing rates and spreads.\\nCompared with the period just before the financial crisis, the System\\'s portfolio of domestic securities has increased from about $800 billion to $2 trillion and has shifted from consisting of 100 percent Treasury securities to having almost two-thirds of its investments in agency-related securities. In addition, the average maturity of the Treasury portfolio nearly doubled, from three and one-half years to almost seven years. The FOMC plans to return the System\\'s portfolio to a more normal size and composition over the longer term, and the Committee has been discussing alternative approaches to accomplish that objective.\\nOne approach is for the Committee to adjust its reinvestment policy--that is, its policy for handling repayments of principal on the securities--to gradually normalize the portfolio over time. Currently, repayments of principal from agency debt and MBS are not being reinvested, allowing the holdings of those securities to run off as the repayments are received. By contrast, the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities are being reinvested in new issues of Treasury securities with similar maturities. At some point, the Committee may want to shift its reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities to shorter-term issues, so as to gradually reduce the average maturity of our Treasury holdings toward pre-crisis levels, while leaving the aggregate value of those holdings unchanged. At this juncture, however, no decision to change reinvestment policy has been made.\\nA second way to normalize the size and composition of the Federal Reserve\\'s securities portfolio would be to sell some holdings of agency debt and MBS. Selling agency securities, rather than simply letting them run off, would shrink the portfolio and return it to a composition of all Treasury securities more quickly. FOMC participants broadly agree that sales of agency-related securities should eventually be used as part of the strategy to normalize the portfolio. Such sales will be implemented in accordance with a framework communicated well in advance and will be conducted at a gradual pace. Because changes in the size and composition of the portfolio could affect financial conditions, however, any decisions regarding the commencement or pace of asset sales will be made in light of the Committee\\'s evaluation of the outlook for employment and inflation.\\nAs I noted earlier, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. At some point, however, the Committee will need to begin to remove monetary policy accommodation to prevent the buildup of inflationary pressures. When that time comes, the Federal Reserve will act to increase short-term interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at Federal Reserve Banks. To tighten the linkage between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term market interest rates, the Federal Reserve may also drain reserves from the banking system. Two tools for draining reserves from the system are being developed and tested and will be ready when needed. First, the Federal Reserve is putting in place the capacity to conduct large reverse repurchase agreements with an expanded set of counterparties. Second, the Federal Reserve has tested a term deposit facility, under which instruments similar to the certificates of deposit that banks offer their customers will be auctioned to depository institutions.\\nOf course, even as the Federal Reserve continues prudent planning for the ultimate withdrawal of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation, we also recognize that the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain. We will continue to carefully assess ongoing financial and economic developments, and we remain prepared to take further policy actions as needed to foster a return to full utilization of our nation\\'s productive potential in a context of price stability.\\nFinancial Reform Legislation\\r\\nLast week, the Congress passed landmark legislation to reform the financial system and financial regulation, and the President signed the bill into law this morning. That legislation represents significant progress toward reducing the likelihood of future financial crises and strengthening the capacity of financial regulators to respond to risks that may emerge. Importantly, the legislation encourages an approach to supervision designed to foster the stability of the financial system as a whole as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions. Within the Federal Reserve, we have already taken steps to strengthen our analysis and supervision of the financial system and systemically important financial firms in ways consistent with the new legislation. In particular, making full use of the Federal Reserve\\'s broad expertise in economics, financial markets, payment systems, and bank supervision, we have significantly changed our supervisory framework to improve our consolidated supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, and we are enhancing the tools we use to monitor the financial sector and to identify potential systemic risks. In addition, the briefings prepared for meetings of the FOMC are now providing increased coverage and analysis of potential risks to the financial system, thus supporting the Federal Reserve\\'s ability to make effective monetary policy and to enhance financial stability.\\nMuch work remains to be done, both to implement through regulation the extensive provisions of the new legislation and to develop the macroprudential approach called for by the Congress. However, I believe that the legislation, together with stronger regulatory standards for bank capital and liquidity now being developed, will place our financial system on a sounder foundation and minimize the risk of a repetition of the devastating events of the past three years.\\nThank you. I would be pleased to respond to your questions.\\n\\n1.

Other meetings were on a larger scale, with more formal agendas focusing on a particular aspect of small business financing, such as minority entrepreneurship, the role of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), or federal guarantee loan programs. Several meetings focused on a specific industry, such as auto suppliers.\\nWhether small or large, all of the meetings brought together small business owners, small business trade groups, financial institutions and other private lenders, bank supervision officials, CDFIs, and other small business support service providers to discuss ways to improve credit flow to viable small businesses. Through this initiative, the Federal Reserve sought to deepen its understanding of the dynamics of the supply of and demand for small business credit, to identify specific credit gaps, and to learn of promising practices and suggestions for improvement.\\nThis summary aims to capture the key issues that emerged from the meetings and offer examples of how those issues were reflected in different parts of the country and in different industries. It is not intended to be a comprehensive compilation of all the ideas and views that were expressed. We have grouped the comments under the categories of credit supply, credit demand, and credit gaps. In addition, we have included key recommendations for potential next steps that were identified by participants at the July 12 capstone event at the Board of Governors as well as throughout the System\\'s series of meetings.\\nFactors Impacting the Supply of Small Business Credit\\r\\nSmall businesses and banks generally reported that lending contracted significantly during the recession for a variety of reasons. These comments are consistent with data indicating that outstanding loans to small businesses dropped from more than $710 billion in the second quarter of 2008 to less than $670 billion in the first quarter of 2010.2 In addition, some banks noted that some of the contraction in lending is related to broader concerns about capital adequacy. Comments related to the supply of credit to small businesses fell into four broad categories: 1) tighter bank underwriting standards; 2) resource constraints on lending; 3) impact of regulatory guidance; and 4) utilization of alternative funding sources.\\nUnderwriting standards – At most meetings, both small businesses and banks acknowledged that underwriting standards had tightened. Some small businesses reported that underwriting changes made access to credit more difficult, but not impossible, while others found the changes to be a significant hurdle to obtaining credit. Many banks acknowledged that lending standards had become more flexible prior to the economic downturn and that they since have returned to more traditional underwriting practices.\\nRecurring issues related to underwriting standards included the following:\\n\\nAdditional collateral requirements – For existing loans, small businesses reported that routine collateral re-evaluations of assets that directly or indirectly secure loans –including personal residences, commercial property, and equipment – often result in additional collateral requirements because of a significant drop in asset values. In addition, in some markets, banks noted they were no longer readily taking real estate as collateral, especially if there was another outstanding lien against the property. Many banks have also reduced their loan-to-value (LTV) thresholds, increasing the amount of equity businesses need for new and refinance loans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nAt a meeting in Cincinnati, small business owners said they were required to make cash payments when reassessments of LTV ratios resulted in insufficient collateral. If the payment was not made, the loan could be subject to default. For new loans, small businesses cited heavy collateral requirements, including personal guarantees, which made them reluctant to secure the loan.\\nIn Detroit, auto suppliers emphasized their concern about the values that lenders are placing on their collateral, particularly equipment. An official with an auto supplier trade group confirmed that many of his group\\'s members have reported issues relating to banks\\' current lower valuation of assets that back existing loans or that are being assessed for new loans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreater focus on cash flow – Some banks acknowledged that prior to the economic crisis, credit scores or collateral values, often inflated, were sometimes more important than cash flow in underwriting a small business loan. Banks and small businesses both concurred that strong cash flow is now one of the chief underwriting criteria.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nAt the Baltimore meeting, several bankers said that they understand the frustration of small businesses that may be experiencing reduced cash flow during the recession but that had a solid track record before the downturn. They noted, however, that generally they cannot extend credit if there is no recent history of positive cash flow. According to one banker, even if a business has strong collateral, banks do not want to be in the business of taking collateral to recoup loan principal.\\nIn Dayton, a small business owner stated: \"If you have the money you need [i.e., good cash flow and collateral], then they\\'ll loan to you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigher personal credit thresholds, including credit score – Small businesses commented that, in response to concerns about declining collateral values and cash flow, the recent trend has been to require more personal resources and guarantees. For many larger banks, automated underwriting driven primarily by credit scores is the only way to profitably offer loans below a certain dollar threshold (e.g., below $200,000). Many small businesses reported being denied credit because either the owner\\'s personal credit score had declined or the score no longer satisfied lenders\\' heightened standards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Boston and Cleveland, small business owners reported that their credit scores declined after credit-limit reductions led to higher debt ratios, despite the fact they were always current with payments. In some cases, the credit score downgrades made it extremely difficult to borrow and resulted in businesses\\' closure or bankruptcy.\\nIn Miami, business owners and intermediaries expressed concern that lenders are placing greater emphasis on business owners\\' personal credit to determine creditworthiness and denying credit to small businesses where the owner has a good business plan but impaired credit.\\n\\n\\n\\nResource Constraints – In addition to capital challenges, banks pointed to a number of other constraints on their lending resources, such as the following:\\n\\nAsset management challenges – Banks reported that higher-than-average delinquency and loss rates have taxed their workout units, forcing them to shift seasoned staff, including loan officers, to assist with the increased number of problem loans. Some banks, particularly smaller banks, described a temporary suspension of all lending activities while they assess portfolios, manage workouts and distressed loans, and reevaluate collateral.\\n\\n\\nRegulatory burden – Smaller banks pointed out the difficulties involved in staying abreast of new regulations and guidance, understanding them thoroughly, and determining how to best implement them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nBecause of the complexity associated with administering new or revised regulations, some community banks said that they often must assign senior loan officers to handle the new rules, leaving more junior lenders to handle new loans. Some small businesses commented that they are then left working with junior loan officers who they believe do not understand their businesses, are dismissive, or adhere mechanically to underwriting guidelines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgrammatic changes – Bank lenders described how enhancements to Small Business Administration (SBA) lending programs, including the increase in guarantee authority and fee waivers, helped them to make loans they might not otherwise have made. Credit unions also reported good success in using the 7(a) loan program, which was in high demand. Suggestions for program improvements included an SBA guarantee for loan modifications, more streamlined and faster loan processing, and packaging assistance for the 7(a) program, similar to what is available for the 504 program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn meetings in Nashville and Tampa, several participants expressed the view that uncertainty about the duration, availability, and conditions of SBA program enhancements has made banks reluctant to invest the time to adapt to new program requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImpact on underwriting time – Banks frequently said that they do not have enough time to handle applications with insufficient documentation, such as sparse tax returns, inadequate income statements, or unreliable interim financial statements. Participants noted that some banks significantly reduced or eliminated loans below a certain threshold, typically $200,000, as a way to limit time-consuming applications from smaller and less sophisticated businesses. Banks also cited the imbalance between time commitment and returns as a reason for not participating in certain SBA loan products, such as the America\\'s Recovery Capital or 7(a) loan programs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Miami, bankers noted that they were spending much more time on due diligence than ever before. The bankers and technical assistance providers agreed this is necessary in a market where fraud is prevalent. However, the extended time it may now take to get a loan approved can hurt small businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImpact of bank closures – Small businesses raised the issue of credit availability in areas that have experienced bank failures. If a financial institution is closed and not replaced, the impact is particularly acute. Small businesses in rural areas and in regions with few banks raised this issue most frequently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn St. Louis, participants described the challenge of \"orphaned\" loans, when a bank that acquires a failed financial institution chooses not to continue the relationship with the borrower, making future extensions of credit unlikely.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegulatory Environment – Some banks cited examination-related concerns as an important factor in credit availability for small businesses. In addition to general statements attributing tightened credit to increased regulatory scrutiny in light of recent economic conditions, concerns were raised about examiner assessments and the uncertainty surrounding classification of assets.\\n\\nRestrictions on lending – Some bank participants noted that because of declining asset values of their balance sheets, more banks have been required to raise capital to cover potential losses. Among other strategies, banks can respond by taking on fewer loans in order to meet the capital requirements or raising capital under adverse economic conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn St. Louis, participants stated they were unsure whether examiners are requiring a 5 percent tier-1 capital ratio standard or whether a stricter 7 percent standard is being applied.\\nSome banks reported inconsistent treatment of loans by different regulators.\\nSeveral banks mentioned that they consider their examiner\\'s expected response before making new loans. They also expressed reluctance to do loan workouts because of concerns that examiners will still regard the loan as being impaired.3 \\nIn New York, Atlanta, and Miami, small businesses and other participants expressed the view that banks are citing increased examiner scrutiny when refusing to lend to certain industries, such as construction, real estate, and retail services.\\nBank regulators stated that banks in South Florida have significant challenges in maintaining adequate capital levels because of the higher loan-loss reserves related to declining asset values.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConflicting messages – Some bank participants expressed frustration about their perception of conflicting messages from different government stakeholders. On the one hand, the banks feel pressure to lend, but at the same time they are encouraged to apply stricter credit standards. The result is a more cautious approach to lending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nSeveral banks expressed concern about lending to small businesses that they believe have the potential to grow when the economy begins to expand. Their concern is that, although a business may have good prospects, regulators may be wary of loans based on future prospects, particularly if the business has less-than-perfect credit, a recent history of uneven cash flow, or reduced collateral values.4 \\n\\n\\n\\nUse of Alternative Funding Sources – Meeting participants noted that small businesses that are denied, or perceive they will be denied, credit by banks have turned to alternative sources of financing, which often carry a higher cost.\\n\\nIncreased use of credit cards – At many meetings, small businesses described turning to credit cards in lieu of a bank loan. At the same time, many small businesses also described how their credit limits were being reduced. After being denied credit, many tapped their personal and business credit cards, particularly for working capital or as a line of credit. Businesses described, and several banks confirmed, that in some cases banks are recommending the use of credit cards in response to requests for smaller loans. Others attributed the increased use of credit cards to the relative ease of applying for and using a credit card as compared to the time and effort required to secure a bank loan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nSome businesses reported incurring additional costs in relying on credit cards. A business owner in Cleveland reported that her bank line of credit, which carried a 7 percent interest rate, was cut. She then turned to a credit card to finance business transactions and subsequently saw the rate on the card substantially increase above her line of credit rate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreater reliance on personal resources – Small business owners frequently mentioned the need to use personal financial resources to replace business credit. Personal credit cards, in particular, are often used because they are easily accessed. Some small businesses said they also relied on home equity lines on their personal residence or on retirement savings. Family and friends are another source often mentioned for small business financing, particularly for start-ups. Current economic challenges, however, have restricted the availability of these sources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Annapolis, a small business owner described being denied for a line of credit because her revenues were down in the prior two years. When she looked into refinancing an investment property to tap its equity, lenders said they were not refinancing investment property. As a result, she relied on credit cards and borrowed against her 401(k) savings for working capital.\\nIn Los Angeles, meeting participants indicated that Asian Pacific Islander (API) small businesses rely heavily on personal real estate for their financing, and the significant decline in residential property values has led to a reduction in credit and rising delinquencies for API small business loans.\\nParticipants in several meetings expressed the view that minority-owned businesses are generally less likely to have an established banking relationship and thus are less likely to receive bank loans. They often turn to friends and family for financing, particularly in the start-up phase.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdjustment of payment terms – Small businesses reported adjusting payment terms in order to preserve cash whenever possible – e.g., shortening payment terms for customers and extending payment terms with suppliers. Small businesses stated that their options were limited when their customers or suppliers, who may also be cash-strapped, are larger firms or the government and thus have more leverage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Milwaukee, a small business owner summarized the phenomenon: \"Receivables have gone up and we have passed that on by stretching our payables. Some customers pay in 70 days, while others pay in 180. My first recommendation: pass a law that says pay in 30 days or pay interest.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlternative financial institutions – Many Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and credit union participants noted an increase in small business loan demand over the last two years. They expressed the view that this may be the result of a tighter supply of credit by larger financial institutions. They noted that their ability to meet increased demand is limited by capital constraints and underwriting capacity. Credit unions also noted the statutory limitation on the percentage of small business loans they may make (12.25 percent of total assets).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nAt several meetings, participants noted that some small businesses are turning toward non-mainstream finance sources such as factoring companies and pay-day loans, which carry higher fees and interest rates, due to the lack of conventional credit sources.\\nIn Detroit, credit union service organizations are working to provide scale for making small business loans by centralizing some aspects of the underwriting process.\\nOn the other hand, in New York, some credit unions indicated that outsourcing underwriting is not always an effective solution to capacity constraints, stating that they lose control over quality in outsourcing.\\nA credit union in Tampa expressed the view that credit unions that are new to small business lending do not have an established infrastructure to compete with the bigger banks, particularly in areas such as SBA programs.\\nIn Nashville, it was noted that some CDFIs are receiving loan applications from businesses that they would not expect to hear from, such as more-established businesses whose financial conditions are better than those of clients they served several years ago.\\nIn Chicago, the Chicago Urban League, which offers bridge loans to companies that have gone through its entrepreneurship training and coaching programs, reported making such loans to businesses that could not get credit from banks. A banker indicated that several banks participating in the meeting were founding investors in the League\\'s loan fund.\\nAt several meetings, CDFI participants described the challenges in becoming authorized to provide loans under the SBA\\'s 7(a) program.\\n\\n\\n\\nFactors Impacting the Demand for Small Business Credit\\r\\nSmall businesses and bank participants noted that the economic downturn has diminished sales for many small businesses, weakening balance sheets and asset values and thus dampening small business loan demand. Some financial institutions reported weaker quality in loan applications from small businesses. Comments related to credit demand by small businesses included issues of reduced credit quality, reduced confidence, a need for additional technical assistance, and interest in government contracting and entrepreneurship.\\nReduced credit quality – Banks generally attributed the decrease in overall lending to small businesses to their declining sales and asset valuations. They reported lower overall demand for credit from creditworthy businesses. Some financial institutions also noted that applications for small business credit generally have become weaker as the challenging economic environment continues. Still, as noted previously, many credit unions and CDFIs cited an increase in demand for small business loans from viable small businesses.\\nReduced confidence – A number of small businesses reported that declining sales made them more cautious about seeking credit. Some commented that the danger in waiting too long was that, by the time they sought a loan, their financial position had deteriorated to a point that raised underwriting concerns. Many small businesses expressed uncertainty about business prospects in the near future, affecting current credit and business decisions. Some owners reported making decisions based on the perception of tight credit without having explored credit options.\\n\\nIn Annapolis, a former small business owner reported selling her health-care business because of concerns that her line of credit would be cut while addressing challenges associated with the extension of payment terms by her clients. Her core business was fine, but she was concerned about liquidity and the ability to meet obligations, such as payroll, in a timely way.\\n\\nIncreased demand for technical assistance – Small businesses described the challenges associated with operating under distressed economic conditions. Many described working with reduced staff and the impact of labor reductions on the resources necessary to manage the credit process. Several bankers indicated that small businesses need help locating suitable lenders and technical assistance to prepare business plans and loan applications. Technical assistance providers indicated that a growing portion of their clients are existing businesses and the long-time unemployed who hope to start a business. Meeting participants also noted the need for technical assistance among minority-owned businesses, which face particular challenges in accessing credit.\\n\\nIn St. Louis, a participant stated that demand for technical assistance is up 150 percent at Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs). Some of this demand stems from increased interest in entrepreneurship among recently unemployed or underemployed individuals.\\nAt several meetings, participants mentioned that minority business owners often do not have strong networks, limiting their access to financial resources, technical assistance, or mentoring.\\nIn Miami, several meeting participants noted that Hispanic businesses face unique challenges due to the lack of tools and training in Spanish. They stated that Hispanic business owners may not be aware of the programs and resources available to assist small businesses or the types of documentation and information that banks require for credit decisions.\\nIn Omaha, nonprofit leaders expressed the view that improving the financial management skills of minority business owners is a critical step in enhancing their creditworthiness.\\n\\nInterest in government contracting – Participants at several meetings mentioned that government contracting is an opportunity for minority-owned businesses, yet they need access to credit to fulfill the contracts. Minority-owned businesses often do not have the working capital needed to make up-front purchases or to sustain operations during the significant payment lag with government contracts.\\n\\nIn Omaha and Nashville, government officials said that they have seen increasing interest among small businesses in becoming a certified minority-owned business for government contracting purposes.\\nIn Birmingham, an SBDC representative said that government contracting is a great opportunity for minority-owned businesses, but the payment lag is a significant challenge.\\n\\nInterest in entrepreneurship – The high-unemployment environment is generating demand as more individuals who are jobless seek to start their own business.\\n\\nParticipants in the Morgantown meeting noted that start-ups are being created by retirees, people seeking a second career, and people looking for first or second jobs.\\nAt the Phoenix meeting, a number of CDFIs and microlenders reported increased interest in their loan products -- one said demand had quadrupled -- from people who lost their jobs and are seeking to start a small business.\\n\\nIdentified Credit Gaps\\r\\nA combination of disruptions on the supply and demand sides of the small business credit market, as discussed above, has resulted in notable credit gaps.\\n\\nLines of credit and working capital – Small businesses reported that existing lines of credit had been reduced, hampering their ability to offset lower cash flows that stem from slower sales or slower customer payments. As a result, small businesses reported that they had to scramble to meet intermediate financing needs and change their business models to adapt to less credit availability. Banks, on the other hand, reported reassessing outstanding lines of credit in order to reduce their exposure to losses and minimize their capital needs. Banks also noted that small businesses had changed how they used their lines in the economic downturn, using them for major purchases and salaries rather than as short-term revolving credit. Some banks noted that, in such situations, they have converted lines of credit into term loans, which have higher finance costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Detroit, the CEO of one auto supplier noted that while most of the manufacturers in the auto industry have restructured so that they are profitable, the companies toward the bottom of the supply chain are still struggling to obtain working capital and to finance their equipment purchases. Other auto suppliers at the meeting noted that many lines of credit were frozen in 2009 and that banks that had historically provided credit to the industry have continued to limit their lending, such as by reducing lines of credit, pricing them higher, or renewing them for more limited periods of time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRefinancing credit – Small businesses expressed concern about their ability to refinance loans, particularly those related to commercial real estate. In some cases, business owners faced an immediate need for cash to repay the balance of their maturing balloon loans, even where the firm still had an ability to repay the loan, because of reduced collateral values or tightened underwriting standards. To address their immediate needs for credit, many small businesses reported using credit cards and personal credit resources, such as 401(k)s and home equity lines of credit. As a result, many small businesses noted the need for loans to refinance these credits at lower rates.\\n\\n\\nSmall-dollar loans – Several small business participants cited the need for smaller dollar loans, particularly in amounts under $200,000. Microlenders in some markets were able to help address the need for loans under $35,000. Larger bank participants acknowledged that they reduced or curtailed small dollar loans altogether because of the expense in time and resources required to make these loans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Des Moines and St. Louis, larger banks indicated that they reduced or stopped providing loans under $200,000 because such loans require as many resources as larger loan amounts but do not provide the needed income to offset these costs.\\nIn Tampa, several technical assistance providers reported that very few banks would offer loans under $100,000, leaving a significant credit gap. The SBA Community Express loan was cited as an option (although some considered it too expensive), but there were no local lenders who offered this product.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommercial real estate – Banks reported that they suffered significant losses in their commercial real estate portfolios. One bank stated that 50% to 60% vacancy rates were not uncommon in his area. Many banks reported that they have tightened underwriting standards in this segment, including requirements for higher borrower equity, stronger debt coverage ratios, lower vacancy rates, as well as stronger personal guarantees. Small businesses confirmed these tighter loan standards and noted that, for existing loans, they were required to pledge additional cash or other assets to make up gaps created by commercial real estate that appraised at lower market values.\\n\\n\\nPatient capital – Both banks and small businesses cited the need for sources of patient capital to assist small businesses in financing equipment and other large purchases. For capital-intensive businesses, such as manufacturing, a larger loan for equipment or materials needs a longer repayment period to provide sufficient time for sales to pick up and generate cash flow for repayment of the loan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Annapolis, service businesses, such as small law firms, discussed the need to hire staff to meet an expected increase in clients or contracts. They cited a lag between the hiring and the receipt of revenues from services provided. Small business participants indicated that banks are not willing to finance this particular need.\\nIn Detroit, a meeting participant pointed out that sustained advancements in technology in the auto supply sector depend on the availability of longer-term financing for the same small businesses that are finding it difficult to finance working capital and the long-overdue replacement of basic equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLoans to distressed industries – Banks reported that they are reducing their exposure to certain industries with high loss rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn New York, bankers noted that certain sectors, such as construction, real estate, and services were particularly hard-hit by the recession, making new loans within these sectors more difficult to finance.\\nIn Cleveland, bankers reported similar constraints on lending in the residential construction, commercial real estate, and automobile sectors. Small businesses affected by the reduction in credit within these industries expressed frustration over their inability to secure loans regardless of the quality of their financial condition.\\nIn Detroit, an automotive supplier industry official noted that credit availability for the tooling required to support new vehicle launches is constrained, given the continued level of industry, customer, and supplier risk. He expressed the view, however, that it is precisely such innovations that will improve the industry\\'s risk/return ratios and investment attractiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStart-up capital – Small businesses and bankers agreed that start-up businesses have always had difficulty obtaining financing, and that now it is almost impossible to secure bank credit. At several meetings, participants noted an increased demand for this type of financing, particularly given the number of unemployed workers who are now looking to start businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\nIn Memphis, start-up capital was identified as a significant need, yet some financial institutions indicated that they lend only to firms with five years of operating experience.\\nA Cleveland meeting that focused on venture capital highlighted the downward trend in the availability of venture capital equity. Participants noted that until financial returns improve, this avenue for funding new and innovative businesses will likely remain suppressed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentified Recommendations\\r\\nThe following are key recommendations for potential next steps that were identified by participants at the July 12 capstone event at the Board of Governors as well as throughout the System\\'s series of meetings. In addition, the Reserve Banks are planning a variety of efforts for the remainder of 2010 to follow up on the information and recommendations from the previous meetings or to hold further meetings in other locations. Attachment B contains a list of some of these activities.\\nRegulatory and Legislative Environment\\n\\nParticipants expressed the need for continued and consistent dialogue between financial institutions and examination staff and greater clarity of supervisory expectations from regulators. They recommended continued use of guidance that includes real-world examples. Another suggestion focused on establishing a means through which institutions can report concerns about or appeal an examiner\\'s decision to the regulatory agency through a neutral intermediary such as an ombudsman.\\nSome participants emphasized the need for greater Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) consideration for community development loans and investments such as Equity Equivalent Investments (EQ2s) or program-related investments. They also noted that banks should receive greater consideration for investments and grants that increase access to lending capital, loan-loss reserves, loan packaging, and technical assistance. Such favorable consideration could encourage banks to engage in activities such as purchasing SBA loans or a participating interest in notes or portfolios; extending lines of credit for the warehousing of SBA loans prior to sale; or providing operating grants to assist CDFIs in obtaining or maintaining authorization required by the SBA or other licensing bodies.\\nThere was a recommendation to make the New Markets Tax Credit program more supportive of small business lending by establishing a safe-harbor provision or taking other steps that could encourage investors to make equity investments in community development entities that lend or invest in small businesses.\\nThere was support expressed for the Administration\\'s proposal for a $30 billion small business lending fund, including: $2 billion to support innovative state programs that seek to stimulate and leverage additional private funds, $1 billion for equity financing for start-ups, and $300 million for CDFI loan funds.\\n\\nSBA-Related Issues\\n\\nParticipants, particularly banks, expressed strong support for the SBA enhancements that extend fee waivers and increase the guarantee limits for the 504 and 7(a) programs. They also emphasized the need for certainty and clear expectations regarding the duration and terms of the enhancements, noting the challenges of adapting to periodic and temporary changes in the programs.\\nParticipants recommended improving access for CDFI loan funds to participate as guaranteed lenders in the SBA 7(a) program in order to increase the availability of credit to the underserved markets that CDFIs serve.\\nThere was general support for more simplification and consistency in SBA regulations, guidelines, and processes to reduce confusion for both lenders and borrowers. One suggestion focused on the possibility of using additional technology, such as a web-based system, to streamline the loan application and notification process.\\nParticipants commented on the need for more education about SBA programs for financial institution examiners. For example, the Federal Reserve recently partnered with the SBA to conduct this type of training, and similar trainings could be arranged with the other financial institution regulators. Additionally, it was suggested that local and regional SBA field examiners could provide more frequent instruction and guidance to lenders.\\nOther recommendations regarding SBA loan programs included setting higher ceilings for loan amounts, such as increasing the microloan limit from $35,000 to $50,000, and expanding the Community Express Pilot program to encompass participation by CDFIs and other mission-driven lenders with sufficient capacity. There was also support for allowing the 504 program to be used for refinancing owner-occupied commercial real estate.\\nSome participants recommended the issuance of regulatory guidance related to SBA 504 first mortgages, including suspending the requirements for extra reserves for classified loans and allowing the refinancing of owner-occupied businesses, even when the loan-to-value ratio has increased.\\n\\nLender-Related Issues\\n\\nParticipants noted the success of financial institutions\\' use of \"second look\" or similar programs to help ensure that viable applicants are not overlooked and that decisions such as credit-line reductions are warranted. Participants recommended broader use of such programs by financial institutions. A lender recommended that, as part of a second-look review, financial institutions consider a borrower\\'s interim financial statements for the most recent six-month period in cases where a borrower has experienced recent improvement and the denial was due to a weaker condition of the borrower as reflected in annual financial statements.\\nLenders emphasized the need to receive complete and accurate documentation from small business loan applicants so that loan decisions can be made in a timely manner. Items such as reliable financial statements and accurate tax identification numbers were highlighted as examples.\\nParticipants noted the use of innovative credit programs to encourage small business borrowing, such as a \"loan-for-hire\" program that reduces the interest rate for an existing small business borrower if the business commits to hiring employees.\\nParticipants also encouraged lenders to demonstrate a greater commitment to and process for referring borrowers to alternative lenders, technical assistance providers, and counselors for appropriate technical assistance and financing solutions.\\n\\nCDFI-Related Issues\\n\\nThere was support expressed for more low-cost, longer-term capital for CDFIs. Such capital, for example, would allow CDFIs to add a risk premium and still be able to make small business loans to meet demand from viable small businesses that may not qualify under conventional bank standards and products. In addition, increased grants or other operational subsidies would help CDFIs to cover the costs of providing technical assistance and advisory services to small business clients as well as to boost their loan-loss reserves.\\nOne participant recommended that policymakers consider capital models for CDFIs that further leverage private dollars and create innovative incentives for the private sector to partner with experienced CDFI fund managers with strong risk-management capacity. For example, the potential allocation of $300 million to CDFI loan funds as part of the proposed $30 billion small business lending fund could be efficiently distributed through the CDFI Fund by a competitive process giving more points to proposals that combine experienced CDFI fund managers with private-sector capital sources and that put the private debt in a first-loss position relative to the public-sector debt capital.\\nParticipants recommended that banks and CDFIs set up more effective and consistent processes for banks to refer small business applicants whose credit needs they cannot meet to CDFIs.\\nOne participant noted that while CDFIs have demonstrated the ability to successfully underwrite the risks inherent in small business loans, this success has been achieved at relatively small volume levels in comparison to the need. He stated that efforts to significantly increase CDFI small business lending capacity must recognize the critical need for scalability in areas such as the receipt and review of applications and the underwriting, servicing, and collections of small business loans. He recommended that CDFIs consider outsourcing some of their operations to providers with more cost-effective approaches, systems, and technologies, including other CDFIs or mainstream financial institutions.\\nParticipants urged greater use by financial institutions and investors of existing evaluation and ratings systems for assessing CDFI performance and impact, such as the CDFI Assessment and Ratings System (CARS) administered by the Opportunity Finance Network.\\nOther suggestions included expanding the access of CDFIs to government small business lending programs such as the Department of Agriculture\\'s Rural Development Program and CDFI Fund financial assistance. One CDFI participant urged modifications to provide improved access for CDFIs to become members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System as well as greater access to Federal Home Loan Bank affordable capital.\\nSome participants expressed the need for limited regulation and oversight of CDFIs to help them improve their performance and access to capital. Comments cautioned against applying the same framework to CDFIs that currently applies to traditional financial institutions in order to ensure that CDFIs continue to have flexibility in underwriting and can focus on their mission-driven activities.\\n\\nSmall Business Support Services\\n\\nParticipants emphasized the importance of both pre- and post-financing technical assistance and the critical need for a dedicated source of funding to adequately compensate providers of such services. They noted the effectiveness of post-loan technical assistance as a risk-mitigation tool, helping to reduce the number of business failures, as well as a way to support business expansion.\\nAdditional suggestions focused on increased use of the SBA Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) and other similar business counseling program as well as initiatives that connect small businesses with each other to facilitate peer mentoring.\\nParticipants noted the need for advisory services to provide guidance to small businesses on the type of capital – from equity to debt – that best matches their financial state and funding needs. Some participants noted that the current dialogue about small business finance tends to emphasize debt even in cases where other forms of capital are more appropriate. Participants also noted that the multitude of government, non-profit, and private sector efforts around small business finance should include consideration of the entire capital structure.\\n\\nResearch and Data\\n\\nParticipants expressed the need for timely, meaningful, and accurate data related to small business lending. Some participants also noted a trade-off between potential benefit of additional data and the increased resources and time needed to gather such data. Potential data collection issues included:\\r\\n\\t\\nMore frequent data collection, such as on a quarterly basis;\\nTime-series data, to allow for a more complete understanding of historical trends and more effective comparative analysis;\\nGreater access to private-sector data;\\nEnhanced segmentation of data, such as by firm size (e.g., number of employees) and loan amount; and\\nGreater collaboration and coordination of data collection among federal agencies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome participants noted data gaps and suggested gathering additional information related to a variety of categories of small business lending including:\\r\\n\\t\\nLoan application and origination information;\\nAppraisal and collateral values for commercial and personal real estate;\\nIntangible assets and their valuation, particularly for virtual or knowledge-based businesses;\\nImproved CDFI lending and microfinance activities;\\nAdvisory services and other technical assistance for small businesses;\\nBusiness start-ups and \"restarts,\" firm size, and firm age; and\\nFactors related to small business growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachment A: List of Federal Reserve System Small Business Meetings\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDate\\nLocation\\nFed District\\nTheme/Description\\n\\n\\n2/3/2010\\nLexington, KY\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n2/8/2010\\nCincinnati, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n2/9/2010\\nCleveland, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n2/10/2010\\nDayton, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n2/10/2010\\nPittsburgh, PA\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n2/11/2010\\nCleveland, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n2/23/2010\\nOmaha, NE\\nKansas City\\nMinority entrepreneurship\\n\\n\\n2/24/2010\\nDenver, CO\\nKansas City\\nSBA guaranteed loan programs\\n\\n\\n2/25/2010\\nSt. Louis, MO\\nSt. Louis\\n_\\n\\n\\n3/4/2010\\nLittle Rock, AR\\nSt. Louis\\n_\\n\\n\\n3/9/2010\\nLas Cruces, NM\\nDallas and Kansas City\\nMinority entrepreneurship\\n\\n\\n3/11/2010\\nNew York, NY\\nNew York\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n3/12/2010\\nNew York, NY\\nNew York\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n3/23/2010\\nNewark, NJ\\nNew York\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n3/26/2010\\nMemphis, TN\\nSt. Louis\\n_\\n\\n\\n3/31/2010\\nLouisville, KY\\nSt. Louis\\n_\\n\\n\\n4/13/2010\\nMorgantown, WV\\nRichmond\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n4/14/2010\\nMinneapolis, MN\\nMinneapolis\\nBank\\'s Small Business Council\\n\\n\\n4/15/2010\\nPhoenix, AZ\\nSan Francisco\\nListening session - CDFI lending\\n\\n\\n4/20/2010\\nChapel Hill, NC\\nRichmond\\n_\\n\\n\\n4/21/2010\\nMiami, FL\\nAtlanta\\nHispanic-owned businesses\\n\\n\\n5/6/2010\\nPittsburgh, PA\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/14/2010\\nMilwaukee, WI\\nChicago\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/18/2010\\nDuluth, MN\\nMinneapolis\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/19/2010\\nSan Francisco, CA\\nSan Francisco\\nSmall business task force\\n\\n\\n5/19/2010\\nDavenport, IA\\nChicago\\nHispanic-owned businesses\\n\\n\\n5/19/2010\\nToledo, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/20/2010\\nIndianapolis, IN\\nChicago\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/20/2010\\nColumbus, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/24/2010\\nCincinnati, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/25/2010\\nNashville, TN\\nAtlanta\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/26/2010\\nCleveland, OH\\nCleveland\\n_\\n\\n\\n5/27/2010\\nMilwaukee, WI\\nChicago\\n_\\n\\n\\n6/2/2010\\nAnnapolis, MD\\nRichmond\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n6/3/2010\\nTampa, FL\\nAtlanta\\n_\\n\\n\\n6/3/2010\\nSpringfield, MA\\nBoston\\nFinancial institutions\\n\\n\\n6/3/2010\\nDetroit, MI\\nChicago\\n_\\n\\n\\n6/7/2010\\nBaton Rouge, LA\\nAtlanta\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n6/8/2010\\nGulfport, MS\\nAtlanta\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n6/11/2010\\nChicago, IL\\nChicago\\n_\\n\\n\\n6/14/2010\\nBaltimore, MD\\nRichmond\\n_\\n\\n\\n6/30/2010\\nPhoenix, AZ\\nSan Francisco\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n6/30/2010\\nShreveport, LA\\nDallas\\nSmall focus group meeting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAttachment B: Planned Reserve Bank Community Affairs Activities on Small Business\\nThe information below describes key activities that Community Affairs Offices of Federal Reserve Banks are planning for the remainder of 2010 in response to issues that were raised at the Federal Reserve System\\'s regional small business meetings or as a way to expand those meetings to other locations.

D.C.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Bernanke presented identical remarks before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on February 25, 2009\\n\\nChairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss monetary policy and the economic situation and to present the Federal Reserve\\'s Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\nRecent Economic and Financial Developments and the Policy ResponsesAs you are aware, the U.S. economy is undergoing a severe contraction.\\xa0 Employment has fallen steeply since last autumn, and the unemployment rate has moved up to 7.6 percent.\\xa0 The deteriorating job market, considerable losses of equity and housing wealth, and tight lending conditions have weighed down consumer sentiment and spending.\\xa0 In addition, businesses have cut back capital outlays in response to the softening outlook for sales as well as the difficulty of obtaining credit.\\xa0 In contrast to the first half of last year, when robust foreign demand for U.S. goods and services provided some offset to weakness in domestic spending, exports slumped in the second half as our major trading partners fell into recession and some measures of global growth turned negative for the first time in more than 25 years.\\xa0 In all, U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) declined slightly in the third quarter of 2008, and that decline steepened considerably in the fourth quarter.\\xa0 The sharp contraction in economic activity appears to have continued into the first quarter of 2009.\\nThe substantial declines in the prices of energy and other commodities last year and the growing margin of economic slack have contributed to a substantial lessening of inflation pressures.\\xa0 Indeed, overall consumer price inflation measured on a 12-month basis was close to zero last month.\\xa0 Core inflation, which excludes the direct effects of food and energy prices, also has declined significantly.\\nThe principal cause of the economic slowdown was the collapse of the global credit boom and the ensuing financial crisis, which has affected asset values, credit conditions, and consumer and business confidence around the world.\\xa0 The immediate trigger of the crisis was the end of housing booms in the United States and other countries and the associated problems in mortgage markets, notably the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market.\\xa0 Conditions in housing and mortgage markets have proved a serious drag on the broader economy both directly, through their impact on residential construction and related industries and on household wealth, and indirectly, through the effects of rising mortgage delinquencies on the health of financial institutions.\\xa0 Recent data show that residential construction and sales continue to be very weak, house prices continue to fall, and foreclosure starts remain at very high levels.\\nThe financial crisis intensified significantly in September and October.\\xa0 In September, the Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, into conservatorship, and Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy.\\xa0 In the following weeks, several other large financial institutions failed, came to the brink of failure, or were acquired by competitors under distressed circumstances.\\xa0 Losses at a prominent money market mutual fund prompted investors, who had traditionally considered money market mutual funds to be virtually risk-free, to withdraw large amounts from such funds.\\xa0 The resulting outflows threatened the stability of short-term funding markets, particularly the commercial paper market, upon which corporations rely heavily for their short-term borrowing needs.\\xa0 Concerns about potential losses also undermined confidence in wholesale bank funding markets, leading to further increases in bank borrowing costs and a tightening of credit availability from banks.\\nRecognizing the critical importance of the provision of credit to businesses and households from financial institutions, the Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act last fall.\\xa0 Under the authority granted by this act, the Treasury purchased preferred shares in a broad range of depository institutions to shore up their capital bases.\\xa0 During this period, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) introduced its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which expanded its guarantees of bank liabilities to include selected senior unsecured obligations and all non-interest-bearing transactions deposits. \\xa0The Treasury--in concert with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC--provided packages of loans and guarantees to ensure the continued stability of Citigroup and Bank of America, two of the world\\'s largest banks.\\xa0 Over this period, governments in many foreign countries also announced plans to stabilize their financial institutions, including through large-scale capital injections, expansions of deposit insurance, and guarantees of some forms of bank debt.\\nFaced with the significant deterioration in financial market conditions and a substantial worsening of the economic outlook, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continued to ease monetary policy aggressively in the final months of 2008, including a rate cut coordinated with five other major central banks.\\xa0 In December the FOMC brought its target for the federal funds rate to a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent, where it remains today.\\xa0 The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.\\nWith the federal funds rate near its floor, the Federal Reserve has taken additional steps to ease credit conditions.\\xa0 To support housing markets and economic activity more broadly, and to improve mortgage market functioning, the Federal Reserve has begun to purchase large amounts of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.\\xa0 Since the announcement of this program last November, the conforming fixed mortgage rate has fallen nearly 1 percentage point.\\xa0 The Federal Reserve also established new lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to enhance the flow of credit to businesses and households.\\xa0 In response to heightened stress in bank funding markets, we increased the size of the Term Auction Facility to help ensure that banks could obtain the funds they need to provide credit to their customers, and we expanded our network of swap lines with foreign central banks to ease conditions in interconnected dollar funding markets at home and abroad.\\xa0 We also established new lending facilities to support the functioning of the commercial paper market and to ease pressures on money market mutual funds.\\xa0 In an effort to restart securitization markets to support the extension of credit to consumers and small businesses, we joined with the Treasury to announce the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\\xa0 The TALF is expected to begin extending loans soon.\\nThe measures taken by the Federal Reserve, other U.S. government entities, and foreign governments since September have helped to restore a degree of stability to some financial markets.\\xa0 In particular, strains in short-term funding markets have eased notably since the fall, and London interbank offered rates (Libor)--upon which borrowing costs for many households and businesses are based--have decreased sharply.\\xa0 Conditions in the commercial paper market also have improved, even for lower-rated borrowers, and the sharp outflows from money market mutual funds seen in September have been replaced by modest inflows.\\xa0 Corporate risk spreads have declined somewhat from extraordinarily high levels, although these spreads remain elevated by historical standards.\\xa0 Likely spurred by the improvements in pricing and liquidity, issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds has been strong, and speculative-grade issuance, which was near zero in the fourth quarter, has picked up somewhat.\\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, conforming fixed mortgage rates for households have declined.\\xa0 Nevertheless, despite these favorable developments, significant stresses persist in many markets.\\xa0 Notably, most securitization markets remain shut, other than that for conforming mortgages, and some financial institutions remain under pressure.\\nIn light of ongoing concerns over the health of financial institutions, the Secretary of the Treasury recently announced a plan for further actions.\\xa0 This plan includes four principal elements:\\xa0 First, a new capital assistance program will be established to ensure that banks have adequate buffers of high-quality capital, based on the results of comprehensive stress tests to be conducted by the financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve.\\xa0 Second is a public-private investment fund in which private capital will be leveraged with public funds to purchase legacy assets from financial institutions.\\xa0 Third, the Federal Reserve, using capital provided by the Treasury, plans to expand the size and scope of the TALF to include securities backed by commercial real estate loans and potentially other types of asset-backed securities as well.\\xa0 Fourth, the plan includes a range of measures to help prevent unnecessary foreclosures.\\xa0 Together, over time these initiatives should further stabilize our financial institutions and markets, improving confidence and helping to restore the flow of credit needed to promote economic recovery. \\nFederal Reserve TransparencyThe Federal Reserve is committed to keeping the Congress and the public informed about its lending programs and balance sheet.\\xa0 For example, we continue to add to the information shown in the Fed\\'s H.4.1 statistical release, which provides weekly detail on the balance sheet and the amounts outstanding for each of the Federal Reserve\\'s lending facilities.\\xa0 Extensive additional information about each of the Federal Reserve\\'s lending programs is available online.1\\xa0 The Fed also provides bimonthly reports to the Congress on each of its programs that rely on the section 13(3) authorities.\\xa0 Generally, our disclosure policies reflect the current best practices of major central banks around the world.\\xa0 In addition, the Federal Reserve\\'s internal controls and management practices are closely monitored by an independent inspector general, outside private-sector auditors, and internal management and operations divisions, and through periodic reviews by the Government Accountability Office.\\xa0 \\nAll that said, we recognize that recent developments have led to a substantial increase in the public\\'s interest in the Fed\\'s programs and balance sheet.\\xa0 For this reason, we at the Fed have begun a thorough review of our disclosure policies and the effectiveness of our communication.\\xa0 Today I would like to highlight two initiatives.\\nFirst, to improve public access to information concerning Fed policies and programs, we recently unveiled a new section of our website that brings together in a systematic and comprehensive way the full range of information that the Federal Reserve already makes available, supplemented by explanations, discussions, and analyses.2\\xa0 We will use that website as one means of keeping the public and the Congress fully informed about Fed programs.\\nSecond, at my request, Board Vice Chairman Donald Kohn is leading a committee that will review our current publications and disclosure policies relating to the Fed\\'s balance sheet and lending policies.\\xa0 The presumption of the committee will be that the public has a right to know, and that the nondisclosure of information must be affirmatively justified by clearly articulated criteria for confidentiality, based on factors such as reasonable claims to privacy, the confidentiality of supervisory information, and the need to ensure the effectiveness of policy.\\xa0 \\nThe Economic Outlook and the FOMC\\'s Quarterly ProjectionsIn their economic projections for the January FOMC meeting, monetary policy makers substantially marked down their forecasts for real GDP this year relative to the forecasts they had prepared in October.\\xa0 The central tendency of their most recent projections for real GDP implies a decline of 1/2 percent to 1-1/4 percent over the four quarters of 2009.\\xa0 These projections reflect an expected significant contraction in the first half of this year combined with an anticipated gradual resumption of growth in the second half. \\xa0The central tendency for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was marked up to a range of 8-1/2 percent to 8-3/4 percent.\\xa0 Federal Reserve policymakers continued to expect moderate expansion next year, with a central tendency of 2-1/2 percent to 3-1/4 percent growth in real GDP and a decline in the unemployment rate by the end of 2010 to a central tendency of 8 percent to 8-1/4 percent. \\xa0FOMC participants marked down their projections for overall inflation in 2009 to a central tendency of 1/4 percent to 1 percent, reflecting expected weakness in commodity prices and the disinflationary effects of significant economic slack.\\xa0 The projections for core inflation also were marked down, to a central tendency bracketing 1 percent.\\xa0 Both overall and core inflation are expected to remain low over the next two years.\\xa0 \\nThis outlook for economic activity is subject to considerable uncertainty, and I believe that, overall, the downside risks probably outweigh those on the upside.\\xa0 One risk arises from the global nature of the slowdown, which could adversely affect U.S. exports and financial conditions to an even greater degree than currently expected. \\xa0Another risk derives from the destructive power of the so-called adverse feedback loop, in which weakening economic and financial conditions become mutually reinforcing.\\xa0 To break the adverse feedback loop, it is essential that we continue to complement fiscal stimulus with strong government action to stabilize financial institutions and financial markets.\\xa0 If actions taken by the Administration, the Congress, and the Federal Reserve are successful in restoring some measure of financial stability--and only if that is the case, in my view--there is a reasonable prospect that the current recession will end in 2009 and that 2010 will be a year of recovery.\\xa0 If financial conditions improve, the economy will be increasingly supported by fiscal and monetary stimulus, the salutary effects of the steep decline in energy prices since last summer, and the better alignment of business inventories and final sales, as well as the increased availability of credit.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nTo further increase the information conveyed by the quarterly projections, FOMC participants agreed in January to begin publishing their estimates of the values to which they expect key economic variables to converge over the longer run (say, at a horizon of five or six years), under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of new shocks to the economy.\\xa0 The central tendency for the participants\\' estimates of the longer-run growth rate of real GDP is 2-1/2 percent to 2-3/4 percent; the central tendency for the longer-run rate of unemployment is 4-3/4 percent to 5 percent; and the central tendency for the longer-run rate of inflation is 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent, with the majority of participants looking for 2 percent inflation in the long run.\\xa0 These values are all notably different from the central tendencies of the projections for 2010 and 2011, reflecting the view of policymakers that a full recovery of the economy from the current recession is likely to take more than two or three years. \\nThe longer-run projections for output growth and unemployment may be interpreted as the Committee\\'s estimates of the rate of growth of output and the unemployment rate that are sustainable in the long run in the United States, taking into account important influences such as the trend growth rates of productivity and the labor force, improvements in worker education and skills, the efficiency of the labor market at matching workers and jobs, government policies affecting technological development or the labor market, and other factors.\\xa0 The longer-run projections of inflation may be interpreted, in turn, as the rate of inflation that FOMC participants see as most consistent with the dual mandate given to it by the Congress--that is, the rate of inflation that promotes maximum sustainable employment while also delivering reasonable price stability.\\xa0 This further extension of the quarterly projections should provide the public a clearer picture of the FOMC\\'s policy strategy for promoting maximum employment and price stability over time.\\xa0 Also, increased clarity about the FOMC\\'s views regarding longer-run inflation should help to better stabilize the public\\'s inflation expectations, thus contributing to keeping actual inflation from rising too high or falling too low.\\xa0 \\nAt the time of our last Monetary Policy Report, the Federal Reserve was confronted with both high inflation and rising unemployment.\\xa0 Since that report, however, inflation pressures have receded dramatically while the rise in the unemployment rate has accelerated and financial conditions have deteriorated.\\xa0 In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve is committed to using all available tools to stimulate economic activity and to improve financial market functioning.\\xa0 Toward that end, we have reduced the target for the federal funds rate close to zero and we have established a number of programs to increase the flow of credit to key sectors of the economy. \\xa0We believe that these actions, combined with the broad range of other fiscal and financial measures being put in place, will contribute to a gradual resumption of economic growth and improvement in labor market conditions in a context of low inflation.\\xa0 We will continue to work closely with the Congress and the Administration to explore means of fulfilling our mission of promoting maximum employment and price stability.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n1.\\xa0 For links and references, see Ben S.

Even so, the financial shocks that hit the global economy in September and October were the worst since the 1930s, and they helped push the global economy into the deepest recession since World War II. The U.S. economy contracted sharply in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. More recently, the pace of decline appears to have slowed significantly, and final demand and production have shown tentative signs of stabilization. The labor market, however, has continued to weaken. Consumer price inflation, which fell to low levels late last year, remained subdued in the first six months of 2009.\\nTo promote economic recovery and foster price stability, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last year brought its target for the federal funds rate to a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent, where it remains today. The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant maintaining the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels for an extended period.\\nAt the time of our February report, financial markets at home and abroad were under intense strains, with equity prices at multiyear lows, risk spreads for private borrowers at very elevated levels, and some important financial markets essentially shut. Today, financial conditions remain stressed, and many households and businesses are finding credit difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, on net, the past few months have seen some notable improvements. For example, interest rate spreads in short-term money markets, such as the interbank market and the commercial paper market, have continued to narrow. The extreme risk aversion of last fall has eased somewhat, and investors are returning to private credit markets. Reflecting this greater investor receptivity, corporate bond issuance has been strong. Many markets are functioning more normally, with increased liquidity and lower bid-asked spreads. Equity prices, which hit a low point in March, have recovered to roughly their levels at the end of last year, and banks have raised significant amounts of new capital.\\nMany of the improvements in financial conditions can be traced, in part, to policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve to encourage the flow of credit. For example, the decline in interbank lending rates and spreads was facilitated by the actions of the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ensure that financial institutions have adequate access to short-term liquidity, which in turn has increased the stability of the banking system and the ability of banks to lend. Interest rates and spreads on commercial paper dropped significantly as a result of the backstop liquidity facilities that the Federal Reserve introduced last fall for that market. Our purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities and other longer-term assets have helped lower conforming fixed mortgage rates. And the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which was implemented this year, has helped restart the securitization markets for various classes of consumer and small business credit.\\nEarlier this year, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulatory agencies undertook the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), popularly known as the stress test, to determine the capital needs of the largest financial institutions. The results of the SCAP were reported in May, and they appeared to increase investor confidence in the U.S. banking system. Subsequently, the great majority of institutions that underwent the assessment have raised equity in public markets. And, on June 17, 10 of the largest U.S. bank holding companies‑‑all but one of which participated in the SCAP--repaid a total of nearly $70 billion to the Treasury.\\nBetter conditions in financial markets have been accompanied by some improvement in economic prospects. Consumer spending has been relatively stable so far this year, and the decline in housing activity appears to have moderated. Businesses have continued to cut capital spending and liquidate inventories, but the likely slowdown in the pace of inventory liquidation in coming quarters represents another factor that may support a turnaround in activity. Although the recession in the rest of the world led to a steep drop in the demand for U.S. exports, this drag on our economy also appears to be waning, as many of our trading partners are also seeing signs of stabilization.\\nDespite these positive signs, the rate of job loss remains high and the unemployment rate has continued its steep rise. Job insecurity, together with declines in home values and tight credit, is likely to limit gains in consumer spending. The possibility that the recent stabilization in household spending will prove transient is an important downside risk to the outlook.\\nIn conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared economic projections covering the years 2009 through 2011. FOMC participants generally expect that, after declining in the first half of this year, output will increase slightly over the remainder of 2009. The recovery is expected to be gradual in 2010, with some acceleration in activity in 2011. Although the unemployment rate is projected to peak at the end of this year, the projected declines in 2010 and 2011 would still leave unemployment well above FOMC participants\\' views of the longer-run sustainable rate. All participants expect that inflation will be somewhat lower this year than in recent years, and most expect it to remain subdued over the next two years.\\nPolicy ChallengesMonetary PolicyIn light of the substantial economic slack and limited inflation pressures, monetary policy remains focused on fostering economic recovery. Accordingly, as I mentioned earlier, the FOMC believes that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be appropriate for an extended period. However, we also believe that it is important to assure the public and the markets that the extraordinary policy measures we have taken in response to the financial crisis and the recession can be withdrawn in a smooth and timely manner as needed, thereby avoiding the risk that policy stimulus could lead to a future rise in inflation.1 The FOMC has been devoting considerable attention to issues relating to its exit strategy, and we are confident that we have the necessary tools to implement that strategy when appropriate.\\nTo some extent, our policy measures will unwind automatically as the economy recovers and financial strains ease, because most of our extraordinary liquidity facilities are priced at a premium over normal interest rate spreads. Indeed, total Federal Reserve credit extended to banks and other market participants has declined from roughly $1.5 trillion at the end of 2008 to less than $600 billion, reflecting the improvement in financial conditions that has already occurred. In addition, bank reserves held at the Fed will decline as the longer-term assets that we own mature or are prepaid. Nevertheless, should economic conditions warrant a tightening of monetary policy before this process of unwinding is complete, we have a number of tools that will enable us to raise market interest rates as needed.\\nPerhaps the most important such tool is the authority that the Congress granted the Federal Reserve last fall to pay interest on balances held at the Fed by depository institutions. Raising the rate of interest paid on reserve balances will give us substantial leverage over the federal funds rate and other short-term market interest rates, because banks generally will not supply funds to the market at an interest rate significantly lower than they can earn risk free by holding balances at the Federal Reserve. Indeed, many foreign central banks use the ability to pay interest on reserves to help set a floor on market interest rates. The attractiveness to banks of leaving their excess reserve balances with the Federal Reserve can be further increased by offering banks a choice of maturities for their deposits.\\nBut interest on reserves is by no means the only tool we have to influence market interest rates. For example, we can drain liquidity from the system by conducting reverse repurchase agreements, in which we sell securities from our portfolio with an agreement to buy them back at a later date. Reverse repurchase agreements, which can be executed with primary dealers, government-sponsored enterprises, and a range of other counterparties, are a traditional and well-understood method of managing the level of bank reserves. If necessary, another means of tightening policy is outright sales of our holdings of longer-term securities. Not only would such sales drain reserves and raise short-term interest rates, but they also could put upward pressure on longer-term interest rates by expanding the supply of longer-term assets. In sum, we are confident that we have the tools to raise interest rates when that becomes necessary to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability. \\nFiscal PolicyOur economy and financial markets have faced extraordinary near-term challenges, and strong and timely actions to respond to those challenges have been necessary and appropriate. I have discussed some of the measures taken by the Federal Reserve to promote economic growth and financial stability. The Congress also has taken substantial actions, including the passage of a fiscal stimulus package. Nevertheless, even as important steps have been taken to address the recession and the intense threats to financial stability, maintaining the confidence of the public and financial markets requires that policymakers begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance. Prompt attention to questions of fiscal sustainability is particularly critical because of the coming budgetary and economic challenges associated with the retirement of the baby-boom generation and continued increases in the costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Addressing the country\\'s fiscal problems will require difficult choices, but postponing those choices will only make them more difficult. Moreover, agreeing on a sustainable long-run fiscal path now could yield considerable near-term economic benefits in the form of lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence. Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability, we risk having neither financial stability nor durable economic growth.\\nRegulatory ReformA clear lesson of the recent financial turmoil is that we must make our system of financial supervision and regulation more effective, both in the United States and abroad. In my view, comprehensive reform should include at least the following key elements:\\n\\na prudential approach that focuses on the stability of the financial system as a whole, not just the safety and soundness of individual institutions, and that includes formal mechanisms for identifying and dealing with emerging systemic risks; \\nstronger capital and liquidity standards for financial firms, with more-stringent standards for large, complex, and financially interconnected firms; \\nthe extension and enhancement of supervisory oversight, including effective consolidated supervision, to all financial organizations that could pose a significant risk to the overall financial system; \\nan enhanced bankruptcy or resolution regime, modeled on the current system for depository institutions, that would allow financially troubled, systemically important nonbank financial institutions to be wound down without broad disruption to the financial system and the economy; \\nenhanced protections for consumers and investors in their financial dealings; \\nmeasures to ensure that critical payment, clearing, and settlement arrangements are resilient to financial shocks, and that practices related to the trading and clearing of derivatives and other financial instruments do not pose risks to the financial system as a whole; and \\nimproved coordination across countries in the development of regulations and in the supervision of internationally active firms. \\nThe Federal Reserve has taken and will continue to take important steps to strengthen supervision, improve the resiliency of the financial system, and to increase the macroprudential orientation of our oversight. For example, we are expanding our use of horizontal reviews of financial firms to provide a more comprehensive understanding of practices and risks in the financial system.\\nThe Federal Reserve also remains strongly committed to effectively carrying out our responsibilities for consumer protection. Over the past three years, the Federal Reserve has written rules providing strong protections for mortgage borrowers and credit card users, among many other substantive actions. Later this week, the Board will issue a proposal using our authority under the Truth in Lending Act, which will include new, consumer-tested disclosures as well as rule changes applying to mortgages and home equity lines of credit; in addition, the proposal includes new rules governing the compensation of mortgage originators. We are expanding our supervisory activities to include risk-focused reviews of consumer compliance in nonbank subsidiaries of holding companies. Our community affairs and research areas have provided support and assistance for organizations specializing in foreclosure mitigation, and we have worked with nonprofit groups on strategies for neighborhood stabilization. The Federal Reserve\\'s combination of expertise in financial markets, payment systems, and supervision positions us well to protect the interests of consumers in their financial transactions. We look forward to discussing with the Congress ways to further formalize our institution\\'s strong commitment to consumer protection.\\nTransparency and AccountabilityThe Congress and the American people have a right to know how the Federal Reserve is carrying out its responsibilities and how we are using taxpayers\\' resources. The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability in its operations. We report on our activities in a variety of ways, including reports like the one I am presenting to the Congress today, other testimonies, and speeches. The FOMC releases a statement immediately after each regularly scheduled meeting and detailed minutes of each meeting on a timely basis. We have increased the frequency and scope of the published economic forecasts of FOMC participants. We provide the public with detailed annual reports on the financial activities of the Federal Reserve System that are audited by an independent public accounting firm. We also publish a complete balance sheet each week.\\n\\nWe have recently taken additional steps to better inform the public about the programs we have instituted to combat the financial crisis. We expanded our website this year to bring together already available information as well as considerable new information on our policy programs and financial activities.2 In June, we initiated a monthly report to the Congress (also posted on our website) that provides even more information on Federal Reserve liquidity programs, including breakdowns of our lending, the associated collateral, and other facets of programs established to address the financial crisis.3 These steps should help the public understand the efforts that we have taken to protect the taxpayer as we supply liquidity to the financial system and support the functioning of key credit markets.\\nThe Congress has recently discussed proposals to expand the audit authority of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) over the Federal Reserve. As you know, the Federal Reserve is already subject to frequent reviews by the GAO. The GAO has broad authority to audit our operations and functions. The Congress recently granted the GAO new authority to conduct audits of the credit facilities extended by the Federal Reserve to \"single and specific\" companies under the authority provided by section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including the loan facilities provided to, or created for, American International Group and Bear Stearns. The GAO and the Special Inspector General have the right to audit our TALF program, which uses funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program.\\nThe Congress, however, purposefully--and for good reason--excluded from the scope of potential GAO reviews some highly sensitive areas, notably monetary policy deliberations and operations, including open market and discount window operations. In doing so, the Congress carefully balanced the need for public accountability with the strong public policy benefits that flow from maintaining an appropriate degree of independence for the central bank in the making and execution of monetary policy. Financial markets, in particular, likely would see a grant of review authority in these areas to the GAO as a serious weakening of monetary policy independence. Because GAO reviews may be initiated at the request of members of Congress, reviews or the threat of reviews in these areas could be seen as efforts to try to influence monetary policy decisions. A perceived loss of monetary policy independence could raise fears about future inflation, leading to higher long-term interest rates and reduced economic and financial stability. We will continue to work with the Congress to provide the information it needs to oversee our activities effectively, yet in a way that does not compromise monetary policy independence.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n1.

Bernanke presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 28, 2008\\n\\r\\n       Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\xa0 In my testimony this morning I will briefly review the economic situation and outlook, beginning with developments in real activity and inflation, then turn to monetary policy.\\xa0 I will conclude with a quick update on the Federal Reserve's recent actions to help protect consumers in their financial dealings.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The economic situation has become distinctly less favorable since the time of our July report.\\xa0 Strains in financial markets, which first became evident late last summer, have persisted; and pressures on bank capital and the continued poor functioning of markets for securitized credit have led to tighter credit conditions for many households and businesses.\\xa0 The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) held up well through the third quarter despite the financial turmoil, but it has since slowed sharply.\\xa0 Labor market conditions have similarly softened, as job creation has slowed and the unemployment rate--at 4.9 percent in January--has moved up somewhat.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Many of the challenges now facing our economy stem from the continuing contraction of the U.S. housing market.\\xa0 In 2006, after a multiyear boom in residential construction and house prices, the housing market reversed course.\\xa0 Housing starts and sales of new homes are now less than half of their respective peaks, and house prices have flattened or declined in most areas.\\xa0 Changes in the availability of mortgage credit amplified the swings in the housing market.\\xa0 During the housing sector's expansion phase, increasingly lax lending standards, particularly in the subprime market, raised the effective demand for housing, pushing up prices and stimulating construction activity.\\xa0 As the housing market began to turn down, however, the slump in subprime mortgage originations, together with a more general tightening of credit conditions, has served to increase the severity of the downturn.\\xa0 Weaker house prices in turn have contributed to the deterioration in the performance of mortgage-related securities and reduced the availability of mortgage credit.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The housing market is expected to continue to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters.\\xa0 Homebuilders, still faced with abnormally high inventories of unsold homes, are likely to cut the pace of their building activity further, which will subtract from overall growth and reduce employment in residential construction and closely related industries.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid pace through much of the second half of 2007, despite the problems in the housing market, but it appears to have slowed significantly toward the end of the year.\\xa0 The jump in the price of imported energy, which eroded real incomes and wages, likely contributed to the slowdown in spending, as did the declines in household wealth associated with the weakness in house prices and equity prices.\\xa0 Slowing job creation is yet another potential drag on household spending, as gains in payroll employment averaged little more than 40,000 per month during the three months ending in January, compared with an average increase of almost 100,000 per month over the previous three months.\\xa0 However, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package should provide some support for household spending during the second half of this year and into next year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The business sector has also displayed signs of being affected by the difficulties in the housing and credit markets.\\xa0 Reflecting a downshift in the growth of final demand and tighter credit conditions for some firms, available indicators suggest that investment in equipment and software will be subdued during the first half of 2008.\\xa0 Likewise, after growing robustly through much of 2007, nonresidential construction is likely to decelerate sharply in coming quarters as business activity slows and funding becomes harder to obtain, especially for more speculative projects. \\xa0On a more encouraging note, we see few signs of any serious imbalances in business inventories aside from the overhang of unsold homes.\\xa0 And, as a whole, the nonfinancial business sector remains in good financial condition, with strong profits, liquid balance sheets, and corporate leverage near historical lows.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition, the vigor of the global economy has offset some of the weakening of domestic demand.\\xa0 U.S. real exports of goods and services increased at an annual rate of about 11 percent in the second half of last year, boosted by continuing economic growth abroad and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar. \\xa0Strengthening exports, together with moderating imports, have in turn led to some improvement in the U.S. current account deficit, which likely narrowed in 2007 (on an annual basis) for the first time since 2001.\\xa0 Although recent indicators point to some slowing of foreign economic growth, U.S. exports should continue to expand at a healthy pace in coming quarters, providing some impetus to domestic economic activity and employment.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I have mentioned, financial markets continue to be under considerable stress.\\xa0 Heightened investor concerns about the credit quality of mortgages, especially subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates, triggered the financial turmoil.\\xa0 However, other factors, including a broader retrenchment in the willingness of investors to bear risk, difficulties in valuing complex or illiquid financial products, uncertainties about the exposures of major financial institutions to credit losses, and concerns about the weaker outlook for economic growth, have also roiled the financial markets in recent months.\\xa0 To help relieve the pressures in the market for interbank lending, the Federal Reserve--among other actions--recently introduced a term auction facility (TAF), through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit are auctioned to eligible borrowers, and we have been working with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives.\\xa0 These efforts appear to have contributed to some improvement in short-term funding markets.\\xa0 We will continue to monitor financial developments closely.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As part of its ongoing commitment to improving the accountability and public understanding of monetary policy making, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently increased the frequency and expanded the content of the economic projections made by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents and released to the public.\\xa0 The latest economic projections, which were submitted in conjunction with the FOMC meeting at the end of January and which are based on each participant's assessment of appropriate monetary policy, show that real GDP was expected to grow only sluggishly in the next few quarters and that the unemployment rate was seen as likely to increase somewhat.\\xa0 In particular, the central tendency of the projections was for real GDP to grow between 1.3 percent and 2.0 percent in 2008, down from 2-1/2 percent to 2-3/4 percent projected in our report last July.\\xa0 FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 have a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent, up from the level of about 4-3/4 percent projected last July for the same period.\\xa0 The downgrade in our projections for economic activity in 2008 since our report last July reflects the effects of the financial turmoil on real activity and a housing contraction that has been more severe than previously expected.\\xa0 By 2010, our most recent projections show output growth picking up to rates close to or a little above its longer-term trend and the unemployment rate edging lower; the improvement reflects the effects of policy stimulus and an anticipated moderation of the contraction in housing and the strains in financial and credit markets. \\xa0The incoming information since our January meeting continues to suggest sluggish economic activity in the near term.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The risks to this outlook remain to the downside.\\xa0 The risks include the possibilities that the housing market or labor market may deteriorate more than is currently anticipated and that credit conditions may tighten substantially further.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consumer price inflation has increased since our previous report, in substantial part because of the steep run-up in the price of oil.\\xa0 Last year, food prices also increased significantly, and the dollar depreciated.\\xa0 Reflecting these influences, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.4 percent over the four quarters of 2007, up from 1.9 percent in 2006.\\xa0 Core price inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices--also firmed toward the end of the year.\\xa0 The higher recent readings likely reflected some pass-through of energy costs to the prices of core consumer goods and services as well as the effect of the depreciation of the dollar on import prices.\\xa0 Moreover, core inflation in the first half of 2007 was damped by a number of transitory factors--notably, unusually soft prices for apparel and for financial services--which subsequently reversed.\\xa0 For the year as a whole, however, core PCE prices increased 2.1 percent, down slightly from 2006.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The projections recently submitted by FOMC participants indicate that overall PCE inflation was expected to moderate significantly in 2008, to between 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent (the central tendency of the projections).\\xa0 A key assumption underlying those projections was that energy and food prices would begin to flatten out, as was implied by quotes on futures markets. \\xa0In addition, diminishing pressure on resources is also consistent with the projected slowing in inflation. \\xa0The central tendency of the projections for core PCE inflation in 2008, at 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent, was a bit higher than in our July report, largely because of some higher-than-expected recent readings on prices.\\xa0 Beyond 2008, both overall and core inflation were projected to edge lower, as participants expected inflation expectations to remain reasonably well-anchored and pressures on resource utilization to be muted.\\xa0 The inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants for 2010--which ranged from 1.5 percent to 2.0\\xa0percent for overall PCE inflation--were importantly influenced by participants' judgments about the measured rates of inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and about the time frame over which policy should aim to attain those rates.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The rate of inflation that is actually realized will of course depend on a variety of factors.\\xa0 Inflation could be lower than we anticipate if slower-than-expected global growth moderates the pressure on the prices of energy and other commodities or if rates of domestic resource utilization fall more than we currently expect.\\xa0 Upside risks to the inflation projection are also present, however, including the possibilities that energy and food prices do not flatten out or that the pass-through to core prices from higher commodity prices and from the weaker dollar may be greater than we anticipate.\\xa0 Indeed, the further increases in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent weeks, together with the latest data on consumer prices, suggest slightly greater upside risks to the projections of both overall and core inflation than we saw last month.\\xa0 Should high rates of overall inflation persist, the possibility also exists that inflation expectations could become less well anchored.\\xa0 Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the FOMC to counter shortfalls in growth in the future.\\xa0 Accordingly, in the months ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor closely inflation and inflation expectations.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Let me turn now to the implications of these developments for monetary policy.\\xa0 The FOMC has responded aggressively to the weaker outlook for economic activity, having reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 225 basis points since last summer.\\xa0 As the Committee noted in its most recent post-meeting statement, the intent of those actions has been to help promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       \\xa0A critical task for the Federal Reserve over the course of this year will be to assess whether the stance of monetary policy is properly calibrated to foster our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability in an environment of downside risks to growth, stressed financial conditions, and inflation pressures.\\xa0 In particular, the FOMC will need to judge whether the policy actions taken thus far are having their intended effects.\\xa0 Monetary policy works with a lag.\\xa0 Therefore, our policy stance must be determined in light of the medium-term forecast for real activity and inflation as well as the risks to that forecast.\\xa0 Although the FOMC participants' economic projections envision an improving economic picture, it is important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain.\\xa0 The FOMC will be carefully evaluating incoming information bearing on the economic outlook and will act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Federal Reserve's recent actions to protect consumers in their financial transactions.\\xa0 In December, following up on a commitment I made at the time of our report last July, the Board issued for public comment a comprehensive set of new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, under the authority granted us by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994.\\xa0 The proposed rules would apply to all mortgage lenders and would establish lending standards to help ensure that consumers who seek mortgage credit receive loans whose terms are clearly disclosed and that can reasonably be expected to be repaid.\\xa0 Accordingly, the rules would prohibit lenders from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced mortgage loans without due regard to consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments.\\xa0 In each case, a lender making a higher-priced loan would have to use third-party documents to verify the income relied on to make the credit decision.\\xa0 For higher-priced loans, the proposed rules would require the lender to establish an escrow account for the payment of property taxes and homeowners' insurance and would prevent the use of prepayment penalties in circumstances where they might trap borrowers in unaffordable loans.\\xa0 In addition, for all mortgage loans, our proposal addresses misleading and deceptive advertising practices, requires borrowers and brokers to agree in advance on the maximum fee that the broker may receive, bans certain practices by servicers that harm borrowers, and prohibits coercion of appraisers by lenders.\\xa0 We expect substantial public comment on our proposal, and we will carefully consider all information and viewpoints while moving expeditiously to adopt final rules.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The effectiveness of the new regulations, however, will depend critically on strong enforcement.\\xa0 To that end, in conjunction with other federal and state agencies, we are conducting compliance reviews of a range of mortgage lenders, including nondepository lenders.\\xa0 The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of, and improved enforcement for, all categories of mortgage lenders.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve continues to work with financial institutions, public officials, and community groups around the country to help homeowners avoid foreclosures.\\xa0 We have called on mortgage lenders and servicers to pursue prudent loan workouts and have supported the development of streamlined, systematic approaches to expedite the loan modification process.\\xa0 We also have been providing community groups, counseling agencies, regulators, and others with detailed analyses to help identify neighborhoods at high risk from foreclosures so that local outreach efforts to help troubled borrowers can be as focused and effective as possible.\\xa0 We are actively pursuing other ways to leverage the Federal Reserve's analytical resources, regional presence, and community connections to address this critical issue.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to our consumer protection efforts in the mortgage area, we are working toward finalizing rules under the Truth in Lending Act that will require new, more informative, and consumer-tested disclosures by credit card issuers.\\xa0 Separately, we are actively reviewing potentially unfair and deceptive practices by issuers of credit cards.\\xa0 Using the Board's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, we expect to issue proposed rules regarding these practices this spring.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you.\\xa0 I would be pleased to take your questions.\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\n\\n\\nCongressional Hearing

Policy Report to the Congress\\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Bernanke presented identical testimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 16, 2008\\n\\nChairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\nThe U.S. economy and financial system have confronted some significant challenges thus far in 2008.\\xa0 The contraction in housing activity that began in 2006 and the associated deterioration in mortgage markets that became evident last year have led to sizable losses at financial institutions and a sharp tightening in overall credit conditions.\\xa0 The effects of the housing contraction and of the financial headwinds on spending and economic activity have been compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, which have sapped household purchasing power even as they have boosted inflation.\\xa0 Against this backdrop, economic activity has advanced at a sluggish pace during the first half of this year, while inflation has remained elevated.\\nFollowing a significant reduction in its policy rate over the second half of 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased policy considerably further through the spring to counter actual and expected weakness in economic growth and to mitigate downside risks to economic activity.\\xa0 In addition, the Federal Reserve expanded some of the special liquidity programs that were established last year and implemented additional facilities to support the functioning of financial markets and foster financial stability.\\xa0 Although these policy actions have had positive effects, the economy continues to face numerous difficulties, including ongoing strains in financial markets, declining house prices, a softening labor market, and rising prices of oil, food, and some other commodities. Let me now turn to a more detailed discussion of some of these key issues.\\nDevelopments in financial markets and their implications for the macroeconomic outlook have been a focus of monetary policy makers over the past year.\\xa0 In the second half of 2007, the deteriorating performance of subprime mortgages in the United States triggered turbulence in domestic and international financial markets as investors became markedly less willing to bear credit risks of any type.\\xa0 In the first quarter of 2008, reports of further losses and write-downs at financial institutions intensified investor concerns and resulted in further sharp reductions in market liquidity.\\xa0 By March, many dealers and other institutions, even those that had relied heavily on short-term secured financing, were facing much more stringent borrowing conditions.\\xa0 \\nIn mid-March, a major investment bank, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., was pushed to the brink of failure after suddenly losing access to short-term financing markets.\\xa0 The Federal Reserve judged that a disorderly failure of Bear Stearns would pose a serious threat to overall financial stability and would most likely have significant adverse implications for the U.S. economy.\\xa0 After discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in consultation with the Treasury, we invoked emergency authorities to provide special financing to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\xa0 In addition, the Federal Reserve used emergency authorities to establish two new facilities to provide backstop liquidity to primary dealers, with the goals of stabilizing financial conditions and increasing the availability of credit to the broader economy.1\\xa0 We have also taken additional steps to address liquidity pressures in the banking system, including a further easing of the terms for bank borrowing at the discount window and increases in the amount of credit made available to banks through the Term Auction Facility.\\xa0 The FOMC also authorized expansions of its currency swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to facilitate increased dollar lending by those institutions to banks in their jurisdictions.\\nThese steps to address liquidity pressures coupled with monetary easing seem to have been helpful in mitigating some market strains.\\xa0 During the second quarter, credit spreads generally narrowed, liquidity pressures ebbed, and a number of financial institutions raised new capital.\\xa0 However, as events in recent weeks have demonstrated, many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress, in part because the outlook for the economy, and thus for credit quality, remains uncertain.\\xa0 In recent days, investors became particularly concerned about the financial condition of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\\xa0 In view of this development, and given the importance of these firms to the mortgage market, the Treasury announced a legislative proposal to bolster their capital, access to liquidity, and regulatory oversight.\\xa0 As a supplement to the Treasury's existing authority to lend to the GSEs and as a bridge to the time when the Congress decides how to proceed on these matters, the Board of Governors authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New\\xa0York to lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should that become necessary.\\xa0 Any lending would be collateralized by U.S. government and federal agency securities.\\xa0 In general, healthy economic growth depends on well-functioning financial markets.\\xa0 Consequently, helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority of the Federal Reserve.\\nI turn now to current economic developments and prospects.\\xa0 The economy has continued to expand, but at a subdued pace.\\xa0 In the labor market, private payroll employment has declined this year, falling at an average pace of 94,000 jobs per month through June.\\xa0 Employment in the construction and manufacturing sectors has been particularly hard hit, although employment declines in a number of other sectors are evident as well.\\xa0 The unemployment rate has risen and now stands at 5-1/2 percent. \\nIn the housing sector, activity continues to weaken.\\xa0 Although sales of existing homes have been about unchanged this year, sales of new homes have continued to fall, and inventories of unsold new homes remain high.\\xa0 In response, homebuilders continue to scale back the pace of housing starts.\\xa0 Home prices are falling, particularly in regions that experienced the largest price increases earlier this decade.\\xa0 The declines in home prices have contributed to the rising tide of foreclosures; by adding to the stock of vacant homes for sale, these foreclosures have, in turn, intensified the downward pressure on home prices in some areas.\\nPersonal consumption expenditures have advanced at a modest pace so far this year, generally holding up somewhat better than might have been expected given the array of forces weighing on household finances and attitudes. \\xa0In particular, with the labor market softening and consumer price inflation elevated, real earnings have been stagnant so far this year; declining values of equities and houses have taken their toll on household balance sheets; credit conditions have tightened; and indicators of consumer sentiment have fallen sharply.\\xa0 More positively, the fiscal stimulus package is providing some timely support to household incomes.\\xa0 Overall, consumption spending seems likely to be restrained over coming quarters.\\nIn the business sector, real outlays for equipment and software were about flat in the first quarter of the year, and construction of nonresidential structures slowed appreciably.\\xa0 In the second quarter, the available data suggest that business fixed investment appears to have expanded moderately.\\xa0 Nevertheless, surveys of capital spending plans indicate that firms remain concerned about the economic and financial environment, including sharply rising costs of inputs and indications of tightening credit, and they are likely to be cautious with spending in the second half of the year.\\xa0 However, strong export growth continues to be a significant boon to many U.S. companies.\\nIn conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared economic projections covering the years 2008 through 2010.\\xa0 On balance, most FOMC participants expected that, over the remainder of this year, output would expand at a pace appreciably below its trend rate, primarily because of continued weakness in housing markets, elevated energy prices, and tight credit conditions.\\xa0 Growth is projected to pick up gradually over the next two years as residential construction bottoms out and begins a slow recovery and as credit conditions gradually improve.\\xa0 However, FOMC participants indicated that considerable uncertainty surrounded their outlook for economic growth and viewed the risks to their forecasts as skewed to the downside.\\xa0 \\nInflation has remained high, running at nearly a 3-1/2 percent annual rate over the first five months of this year as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures.\\xa0 And, with gasoline and other consumer energy prices rising in recent weeks, inflation seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term. \\nThe elevated level of overall consumer inflation largely reflects a continued sharp run-up in the prices of many commodities, especially oil but also certain crops and metals.2\\xa0 The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil soared about 60 percent in 2007 and, thus far this year, has climbed an additional 50 percent or so.\\xa0 The price of oil currently stands at about five times its level toward the beginning of this decade.\\xa0 Our best judgment is that this surge in prices has been driven predominantly by strong growth in underlying demand and tight supply conditions in global oil markets.\\xa0 Over the past several years, the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades, leading to substantial increases in the demand for oil.\\xa0 Moreover, growth has been concentrated in developing and emerging market economies, where energy consumption has been further stimulated by rapid industrialization and by government subsidies that hold down the price of energy faced by ultimate users.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nOn the supply side, despite sharp increases in prices, the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years.\\xa0 Much of the subdued supply response reflects inadequate investment and production shortfalls in politically volatile regions where large portions of the world's oil reserves are located.\\xa0 Additionally, many governments have been tightening their control over oil resources, impeding foreign investment and hindering efforts to boost capacity and production.\\xa0 Finally, sustainable rates of production in some of the more secure and accessible oil fields, such as those in the North Sea, have been declining.\\xa0 In view of these factors, estimates of long-term oil supplies have been marked down in recent months.\\xa0 Long-dated oil futures prices have risen along with spot prices, suggesting that market participants also see oil supply conditions remaining tight for years to come.\\nThe decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar has also contributed somewhat to the increase in oil prices.\\xa0 The precise size of this effect is difficult to ascertain, as the causal relationships between oil prices and the dollar are complex and run in both directions.\\xa0 However, the price of oil has risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that factors other than the dollar, notably shifts in the underlying global demand for and supply of oil, have been the principal drivers of the increase in prices. \\nAnother concern that has been raised is that financial speculation has added markedly to upward pressures on oil prices.\\xa0 Certainly, investor interest in oil and other commodities has increased substantially of late.\\xa0 However, if financial speculation were pushing oil prices above the levels consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell.\\xa0 But in fact, available data on oil inventories show notable declines over the past year.\\xa0 This is not to say that useful steps could not be taken to improve the transparency and functioning of futures markets, only that such steps are unlikely to substantially affect the prices of oil or other commodities in the longer term.\\nAlthough the inflationary effect of rising oil and agricultural commodity prices is evident in the retail prices of energy and food, the extent to which the high prices of oil and other raw materials have been passed through to the prices of non-energy, non-food finished goods and services seems thus far to have been limited. \\xa0But with businesses facing persistently higher input prices, they may attempt to pass through such costs into prices of final goods and services more aggressively than they have so far. \\xa0Moreover, as the foreign exchange value of the dollar has declined, rises in import prices have put greater upward pressure on business costs and consumer prices.\\xa0 In their economic projections for the June FOMC meeting, monetary policy makers marked up their forecasts for inflation during 2008 as a whole.\\xa0 FOMC participants continue to expect inflation to moderate in 2009 and 2010, as slower global growth leads to a cooling of commodity markets, as pressures on resource utilization decline, and as longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.\\xa0 However, in light of the persistent escalation of commodity prices in recent quarters, FOMC participants viewed the inflation outlook as unusually uncertain and cited the possibility that commodity prices will continue to rise as an important risk to the inflation forecast. \\xa0Moreover, the currently high level of inflation, if sustained, might lead the public to revise up its expectations for longer-term inflation.\\xa0 If that were to occur, and those revised expectations were to become embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process, we could see an unwelcome rise in actual inflation over the longer term.\\xa0 A critical responsibility of monetary policy makers is to prevent that process from taking hold.\\nAt present, accurately assessing and appropriately balancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation is a significant challenge for monetary policy makers.\\xa0 The possibility of higher energy prices, tighter credit conditions, and a still-deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth.\\xa0 At the same time, upside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified lately, as the rising prices of energy and some other commodities have led to a sharp pickup in inflation and some measures of inflation expectations have moved higher.\\xa0 Given the high degree of uncertainty, monetary policy makers will need to carefully assess incoming information bearing on the outlook for both inflation and growth.\\xa0 In light of the increase in upside inflation risk, we must be particularly alert to any indications, such as an erosion of longer-term inflation expectations, that the inflationary impulses from commodity prices are becoming embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process.\\nI would like to conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on some of the Federal Reserve's actions in the area of consumer protection.\\xa0 At the time of our report last February, I described the Board's proposal to adopt comprehensive new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, using our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994.\\xa0 After reviewing the more-than 4,500 comment letters we received on the proposed rules, the Board approved the final rules yesterday.\\xa0 \\nThe new rules apply to all types of mortgage lenders and will establish lending standards aimed at curbing abuses while preserving responsible subprime lending and sustainable homeownership.\\xa0 The final rules prohibit lenders from making higher-priced loans without due regard for consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments and require lenders to verify the income and assets on which they rely when making the credit decision.\\xa0 Also, for higher-priced loans, lenders now will be required to establish escrow accounts so that property taxes and insurance costs will be included in consumers' regular monthly payments.\\xa0 The final rules also prohibit prepayment penalties for higher-priced loans in cases in which the consumer's payment can increase during the first few years and restrict prepayment penalties on other higher-priced loans\\xa0 Other measures address the coercion of appraisers, servicer practices, and other issues.\\xa0 We believe the new rules will help to restore confidence in the mortgage market.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nIn May, working jointly with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration, the Board issued proposed rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act to address unfair or deceptive practices for credit card accounts and overdraft protection plans.\\xa0 Credit cards provide a convenient source of credit for many consumers, but the terms of credit card loans have become more complex, which has reduced transparency.\\xa0 Our consumer testing has persuaded us that disclosures alone cannot solve this problem.\\xa0 Thus, the Board's proposed rules would require card issuers to alter their practices in ways that will allow consumers to better understand how their own decisions and actions will affect their costs.\\xa0 Card issuers would be prohibited from increasing interest rates retroactively to cover prior purchases except under very limited circumstances.\\xa0 For accounts having multiple interest rates, when consumers seek to pay down their balance by paying more than the minimum, card issuers would be prohibited from maximizing interest charges by applying excess payments to the lowest rate balance first.\\xa0 The proposed rules dealing with bank overdraft services seek to give consumers greater control by ensuring that they have ample opportunity to opt out of automatic payments of overdrafts. \\xa0The Board has already received more than 20,000 comment letters in response to the proposed rules.\\nThank you.\\xa0 I would be pleased to take your questions.\\n\\n\\nFootnotes\\n1.\\xa0 Primary dealers are financial institutions that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal

Policy Report to the Congress\\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Bernanke presented identical testimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on February 15, 2007\\n\\r\\n       Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Real activity in the United States expanded at a solid pace in 2006, although the pattern of growth was uneven. After a first-quarter rebound from weakness associated with the effects of the hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf Coast the previous summer, output growth moderated somewhat on average over the remainder of 2006. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of about 2-3/4 percent in the second half of the year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As we anticipated in our July report, the U.S. economy appears to be making a transition from the rapid rate of expansion experienced over the preceding several years to a more sustainable average pace of growth. The principal source of the ongoing moderation has been a substantial cooling in the housing market, which has led to a marked slowdown in the pace of residential construction. However, the weakness in housing market activity and the slower appreciation of house prices do not seem to have spilled over to any significant extent to other sectors of the economy. Consumer spending has continued to expand at a solid rate, and the demand for labor has remained strong. On average, about 165,000 jobs per month have been added to nonfarm payrolls over the past six months, and the unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent in January, remains low.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation pressures appear to have abated somewhat following a run-up during the first half of 2006. Overall inflation has fallen, in large part as a result of declines in the price of crude oil. Readings on core inflation--that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy--have improved modestly in recent months. Nevertheless, the core inflation rate remains somewhat elevated.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the five policy meetings since the July report, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. So far, the incoming data have supported the view that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable economic growth and a gradual ebbing of core inflation. However, in the statement accompanying last month's policy decision, the FOMC again indicated that its predominant policy concern is the risk that inflation will fail to ease as expected and that it is prepared to take action to address inflation risks if developments warrant.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Let me now discuss the economic outlook in a little more detail, beginning with developments in the real economy and then turning to inflation. I will conclude with some brief comments on monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consumer spending continues to be the mainstay of the current economic expansion. Personal consumption expenditures, which account for more than two-thirds of aggregate demand, increased at an annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent in real terms during the second half of last year, broadly matching the brisk pace of the previous three years. Consumer outlays were supported by strong gains in personal income, reflecting both the ongoing increases in payroll employment and a pickup in the growth of real wages. Real hourly compensation--as measured by compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector deflated by the personal consumption expenditures price index--rose at an annual rate of around 3 percent in the latter half of 2006.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The resilience of consumer spending is all the more striking given the backdrop of the substantial correction in the housing market that became increasingly evident during the spring and summer of last year. By the middle of 2006, monthly sales of new and existing homes were about 15 percent lower than a year earlier, and the previously rapid rate of house-price appreciation had slowed markedly. The fall in housing demand in turn prompted a sharp slowing in the pace of construction of new homes. Even so, the backlog of unsold homes rose from about four-and-a-half months' supply in 2005 to nearly seven months' supply by the third quarter of last year. Single-family housing starts have dropped more than 30 percent since the beginning of last year, and employment growth in the construction sector has slowed substantially.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Some tentative signs of stabilization have recently appeared in the housing market: New and existing home sales have flattened out in recent months, mortgage applications have picked up, and some surveys find that homebuyers' sentiment has improved. However, even if housing demand falls no further, weakness in residential investment is likely to continue to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters as homebuilders seek to reduce their inventories of unsold homes to more-comfortable levels.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Despite the ongoing adjustments in the housing sector, overall economic prospects for households remain good. Household finances appear generally solid, and delinquency rates on most types of consumer loans and residential mortgages remain low. The exception is subprime mortgages with variable interest rates, for which delinquency rates have increased appreciably. The labor market is expected to stay healthy, and real incomes should continue to rise, although the pace of employment gains may be slower than that to which we have become accustomed in recent years. In part, slower average job growth may simply reflect the moderation of economic activity. Also, the impending retirement of the leading edge of the baby-boom generation, and an apparent leveling out of women's participation rate in the workforce, which had risen for several decades, will likely restrain the growth of the labor force in coming years. With fewer jobseekers entering the labor force, the rate of job creation associated with the maintenance of stable conditions in the labor market will decline. All told, consumer expenditures appear likely to expand solidly in coming quarters, albeit a little less rapidly than the growth in personal incomes if, as we expect, households respond to the slow pace of home-equity appreciation by saving more out of current income.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The business sector remains in excellent financial condition, with strong growth in profits, liquid balance sheets, and corporate leverage near historical lows. Last year, those factors helped to support continued advances in business capital expenditures. Notably, investment in high-tech equipment rose 9 percent in 2006, and spending on nonresidential structures (such as office buildings, factories, and retail space) increased rapidly through much of the year after several years of weakness. Growth in business spending slowed toward the end of last year, reflecting mainly a deceleration of spending on business structures; a drop in outlays in the transportation sector, where spending is notably volatile; and some weakness in purchases of equipment related to construction and motor vehicle manufacturing. Over the coming year, capital spending is poised to expand at a moderate pace, supported by steady gains in business output and favorable financial conditions. Inventory levels in some sectors--most notably at motor vehicle dealers and in some construction-related manufacturing industries--rose over the course of last year, leading some firms to cut production to better align inventories with sales. Remaining imbalances may continue to impose modest restraint on industrial production during the early part of this year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Outside the United States, economic activity in our major trading partners has continued to grow briskly. The strength of demand abroad helped spur a robust expansion in U.S. real exports, which grew about 9 percent last year. The pattern of real U.S imports was somewhat uneven, partly because of fluctuations in oil imports over the course of the year. On balance, import growth slowed in 2006, to 3 percent. Economic growth abroad should support further steady growth in U.S. exports this year. Despite the improvements in trade performance, the U.S. current account deficit remains large, averaging about 6-1/2 percent of nominal GDP during the first three quarters of 2006 (the latest available data).\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Overall, the U.S. economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace this year and next, with growth strengthening somewhat as the drag from housing diminishes. Such an outlook is reflected in the projections that the members of the Board of Governors and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks made around the time of the FOMC meeting late last month. The central tendency of those forecasts--which are based on the information available at that time and on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy--is for real GDP to increase about 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 2007 and about 2-3/4 to 3 percent in 2008. The projection for GDP growth in 2007 is slightly lower than our projection last July. This difference partly reflects an expectation of somewhat greater weakness in residential construction during the first part of this year than we anticipated last summer. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2007 and 2008 around 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The risks to this outlook are significant. To the downside, the ultimate extent of the housing market correction is difficult to forecast and may prove greater than we anticipate. Similarly, spillover effects from developments in the housing market onto consumer spending and employment in housing-related industries may be more pronounced than expected. To the upside, output may expand more quickly than expected if consumer spending continues to increase at the brisk pace seen in the second half of 2006.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       I turn now to the inflation situation. As I noted earlier, there are some indications that inflation pressures are beginning to diminish. The monthly data are noisy, however, and it will consequently be some time before we can be confident that underlying inflation is moderating as anticipated. Recent declines in overall inflation have primarily reflected lower prices for crude oil, which have fed through to the prices of gasoline, heating oil, and other energy products used by consumers. After moving higher in the first half of 2006, core consumer price inflation has also edged lower recently, reflecting a relatively broad-based deceleration in the prices of core goods. That deceleration is probably also due to some extent to lower energy prices, which have reduced costs of production and thereby lessened one source of pressure on the prices of final goods and services. The ebbing of core inflation has likely been promoted as well by the stability of inflation expectations.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       A waning of the temporary factors that boosted inflation in recent years will probably help foster a continued edging down of core inflation. In particular, futures quotes imply that oil prices are expected to remain well below last year's peak. If actual prices follow the path currently indicated by futures prices, inflation pressures would be reduced further as the benefits of the decline in oil prices from last year's high levels are passed through to a broader range of core goods and services. Nonfuel import prices may also put less pressure on core inflation, particularly if price increases for some other commodities, such as metals, slow from last year's rapid rates. But as we have been reminded only too well in recent years, the prices of oil and other commodities are notoriously difficult to predict, and they remain a key source of uncertainty to the inflation outlook. The contribution from rents and shelter costs should also fall back, following a step-up last year. The faster pace of rent increases last year may have been attributable in part to the reduced affordability of owner-occupied housing, which led to a greater demand for rental housing. Rents should rise somewhat less quickly this year and next, reflecting recovering demand for owner-occupied housing as well as increases in the supply of rental units, but the extent and pace of that adjustment is not yet clear.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Upward pressure on inflation could materialize if final demand were to exceed the underlying productive capacity of the economy for a sustained period. The rate of resource utilization is high, as can be seen in rates of capacity utilization above their long-term average and, most evidently, in the tightness of the labor market. Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that businesses are having difficulty recruiting well-qualified workers in certain occupations. Measures of labor compensation, though still growing at a moderate pace, have shown some signs of acceleration over the past year, likely in part the result of tight labor market conditions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The implications for inflation of faster growth in nominal labor compensation depend on several factors. Increases in compensation might be offset by higher labor productivity or absorbed by a narrowing of firms' profit margins rather than passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices; in these circumstances, gains in nominal compensation would translate into gains in real compensation as well. Underlying productivity trends appear favorable, and the markup of prices over unit labor costs is high by historical standards, so such an outcome is certainly possible. Moreover, if activity expands over the next year or so at the moderate pace anticipated by the FOMC, pressures in both labor and product markets should ease modestly. That said, the possibility remains that tightness in product markets could allow firms to pass higher labor costs through to prices, adding to inflation and effectively nullifying the purchasing power of at least some portion of the increase in labor compensation. Thus, the high level of resource utilization remains an important upside risk to continued progress on inflation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Another significant factor influencing medium-term trends in inflation is the public's expectations of inflation. These expectations have an important bearing on whether transitory influences on prices, such as those created by changes in energy costs, become embedded in wage and price decisions and so leave a lasting imprint on the rate of inflation. It is encouraging that inflation expectations appear to have remained contained.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The projections of the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks are for inflation to continue to ebb over this year and next. In particular, the central tendency of those forecasts is for core inflation--as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy--to be 2 to 2-1/4 percent this year and to edge lower, to 1-3/4 to 2 percent, next year. But as I noted earlier, the FOMC has continued to view the risk that inflation will not moderate as expected as the predominant policy concern.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Monetary policy affects spending and inflation with long and variable lags. Consequently, policy decisions must be based on an assessment of medium-term economic prospects. At the same time, because economic forecasting is an uncertain enterprise, policymakers must be prepared to respond flexibly to developments in the economy when those developments lead to a re-assessment of the outlook. The dependence of monetary policy actions on a broad range of incoming information complicates the public's attempts to understand and anticipate policy decisions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Clear communication by the central bank about the economic outlook, the risks to that outlook, and its monetary policy strategy can help the public to understand the rationale behind policy decisions and to anticipate better the central bank's reaction to new information. This understanding should, in turn, enhance the effectiveness of policy and lead to improved economic outcomes. By reducing uncertainty, central bank transparency may also help anchor the public's longer-term expectations of inflation. Much experience has shown that well-anchored inflation expectations tend to help stabilize inflation and promote maximum sustainable economic growth. Good communication by the central bank is also vital for ensuring appropriate accountability for its policy actions, the full effects of which can be observed only after a lengthy period. A transparent policy process improves accountability by clarifying how a central bank expects to attain its policy objectives and by ensuring that policy is conducted in a manner that can be seen to be consistent with achieving those objectives.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Over the past decade or so, the Federal Reserve has significantly improved its methods of communication, but further progress is possible. As you know, the FOMC last year established a subcommittee to help the full Committee evaluate the next steps in this continuing process. Our discussions are directed at examining all aspects of our communications and have been deliberate and thorough. These discussions are continuing, and no decisions have been reached. My colleagues and I remain firmly committed to an open and transparent monetary policy process that enhances our ability to achieve our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. I will keep members of this Committee apprised of developments as our deliberations move forward. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the members of this Committee and your colleagues in the Senate and House on the important issues pertaining to monetary policy and the other responsibilities with which the Congress has charged the Federal Reserve.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Thank you.

Bernanke\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Bernanke presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 19, 2007\\n\\r\\n       Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\xa0 As you know, this occasion marks the thirtieth year of semiannual testimony on the economy and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.\\xa0 In establishing these hearings, the Congress proved prescient in anticipating the worldwide trend toward greater transparency and accountability of central banks in the making of monetary policy.\\xa0 Over the years, these testimonies and the associated reports have proved an invaluable vehicle for the Federal Reserve's communication with the public about monetary policy, even as they have served to enhance the Federal Reserve's accountability for achieving the dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability set for it by the Congress.\\xa0 I take this opportunity to reiterate the Federal Reserve's strong support of the dual mandate; in pursuing maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy makes its greatest possible contribution to the general economic welfare.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Let me now review the current economic situation and the outlook, beginning with developments in the real economy and the situation regarding inflation before turning to monetary policy.\\xa0 I will conclude with comments on issues related to lending to households and consumer protection--topics not normally addressed in monetary policy testimony but, in light of recent developments, deserving of our attention today.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       After having run at an above-trend rate earlier in the current economic recovery, U.S. economic growth has proceeded during the past year at a pace more consistent with sustainable expansion.\\xa0 Despite the downshift in growth, the demand for labor has remained solid, with more than 850,000 jobs having been added to payrolls thus far in 2007 and the unemployment rate having remained at 4-1/2 percent. The combination of moderate gains in output and solid advances in employment implies that recent increases in labor productivity have been modest by the standards of the past decade.\\xa0 The cooling of productivity growth in recent quarters is likely the result of cyclical or other temporary factors, but the underlying pace of productivity gains may also have slowed somewhat.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       To a considerable degree, the slower pace of economic growth in recent quarters reflects the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector.\\xa0 Over the past year, home sales and construction have slowed substantially and house prices have decelerated.\\xa0 Although a leveling-off of home sales in the second half of 2006 suggested some tentative stabilization of housing demand, sales have softened further this year, leading the number of unsold new homes in builders' inventories to rise further relative to the pace of new home sales.\\xa0 Accordingly, construction of new homes has sunk further, with starts of new single-family houses thus far this year running 10 percent below the pace in the second half of last year.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The pace of home sales seems likely to remain sluggish for a time, partly as a result of some tightening in lending standards and the recent increase in mortgage interest rates.\\xa0 Sales should ultimately be supported by growth in income and employment as well as by mortgage rates that--despite the recent increase--remain fairly low relative to historical norms.\\xa0 However, even if demand stabilizes as we expect, the pace of construction will probably fall somewhat further as builders work down stocks of unsold new homes.\\xa0 Thus, declines in residential construction will likely continue to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters, although the magnitude of the drag on growth should diminish over time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Real consumption expenditures appear to have slowed last quarter, following two quarters of rapid expansion.\\xa0 Consumption outlays are likely to continue growing at a moderate pace, aided by a strong labor market.\\xa0 Employment should continue to expand, though possibly at a somewhat slower pace than in recent years as a result of the recent moderation in the growth of output and ongoing demographic shifts that are expected to lead to a gradual decline in labor force participation.\\xa0 Real compensation appears to have risen over the past year, and barring further sharp increases in consumer energy costs, it should rise further as labor demand remains strong and productivity increases.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the business sector, investment in equipment and software showed a modest gain in the first quarter.\\xa0 A similar outcome is likely for the second quarter, as weakness in the volatile transportation equipment category appears to have been offset by solid gains in other categories.\\xa0 Investment in nonresidential structures, after slowing sharply late last year, seems to have grown fairly vigorously in the first half of 2007.\\xa0 Like consumption spending, business fixed investment overall seems poised to rise at a moderate pace, bolstered by gains in sales and generally favorable financial conditions.\\xa0 Late last year and early this year, motor vehicle manufacturers and firms in several other industries found themselves with elevated inventories, which led them to reduce production to better align inventories with sales.\\xa0 Excess inventories now appear to have been substantially eliminated and should not prove a further restraint on growth.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The global economy continues to be strong.\\xa0 Supported by solid economic growth abroad, U.S. exports should expand further in coming quarters.\\xa0 Nonetheless, our trade deficit--which was about 5-1/4 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter--is likely to remain high.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       For the most part, financial markets have remained supportive of economic growth.\\xa0 However, conditions in the subprime mortgage sector have deteriorated significantly, reflecting mounting delinquency rates on adjustable-rate loans.\\xa0 In recent weeks, we have also seen increased concerns among investors about credit risk on some other types of financial instruments.\\xa0 Credit spreads on lower-quality corporate debt have widened somewhat, and terms for some leveraged business loans have tightened.\\xa0 Even after their recent rise, however, credit spreads remain near the low end of their historical ranges, and financing activity in the bond and business loan markets has remained fairly brisk.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       Overall, the U.S. economy appears likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007, with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend.\\xa0 Such an assessment was made around the time of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in deliberations on monetary policy. \\xa0The central tendency of the growth forecasts, which are conditioned on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, is for real GDP to expand roughly 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent this year and 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent in 2008.\\xa0 The forecasted performance for this year is about 1/4 percentage point below that projected in February, the difference being largely the result of weaker-than-expected residential construction activity this year.\\xa0 The unemployment rate is anticipated to edge up to between 4-1/2 and 4-3/4 percent over the balance of this year and about 4-3/4 percent in 2008, a trajectory about the same as the one expected in February.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       I turn now to the inflation situation.\\xa0 Sizable increases in food and energy prices have boosted overall inflation and eroded real incomes in recent months--both unwelcome developments.\\xa0 As measured by changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), inflation ran at an annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first five months of this year, a rate that, if maintained, would clearly be inconsistent with the objective of price stability.  1\\xa0 Because monetary policy works with a lag, however, policymakers must focus on the economic outlook.\\xa0 Food and energy prices tend to be quite volatile, so that, looking forward, core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) may be a better gauge than overall inflation of underlying inflation trends.\\xa0 Core inflation has moderated slightly over the past few months, with core PCE inflation coming in at an annual rate of about 2 percent so far this year.\\n\\r\\n       Although the most recent readings on core inflation have been favorable, month-to-month movements in inflation are subject to considerable noise, and some of the recent improvement could also be the result of transitory influences. \\xa0However, with long-term inflation expectations contained, futures prices suggesting that investors expect energy and other commodity prices to flatten out, and pressures in both labor and product markets likely to ease modestly, core inflation should edge a bit lower, on net, over the remainder of this year and next year.\\xa0 The central tendency of FOMC participants' forecasts for core PCE inflation--2 to 2-1/4 percent for 2007 and 1-3/4 to 2 percent in 2008--is unchanged from February.\\xa0 If energy prices level off as currently anticipated, overall inflation should slow to a pace close to that of core inflation in coming quarters.\\n\\r\\n       At each of its four meetings so far this year, the FOMC maintained its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent, judging that the existing stance of policy was likely to be consistent with growth running near trend and inflation staying on a moderating path.\\xa0 As always, in determining the appropriate stance of policy, we will be alert to the possibility that the economy is not evolving in the way we currently judge to be the most likely.\\xa0 One risk to the outlook is that the ongoing housing correction might prove larger than anticipated, with possible spillovers onto consumer spending.\\xa0 Alternatively, consumer spending, which has advanced relatively vigorously, on balance, in recent quarters, might expand more quickly than expected; in that case, economic growth could rebound to a pace above its trend.\\xa0 With the level of resource utilization already elevated, the resulting pressures in labor and product markets could lead to increased inflation over time.\\xa0 Yet another risk is that energy and commodity prices could continue to rise sharply, leading to further increases in headline inflation and, if those costs passed through to the prices of non-energy goods and services, to higher core inflation as well.\\xa0 Moreover, if inflation were to move higher for an extended period and that increase became embedded in longer-term inflation expectations, the re-establishment of price stability would become more difficult and costly to achieve.\\xa0 With the level of resource utilization relatively high and with a sustained moderation in inflation pressures yet to be convincingly demonstrated, the FOMC has consistently stated that upside risks to inflation are its predominant policy concern.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve has an important responsibility to help protect consumers in financial services transactions.\\xa0 For nearly forty years, the Federal Reserve has been active in implementing, interpreting, and enforcing consumer protection laws.\\xa0 I would like to discuss with you this morning some of our recent initiatives and actions, particularly those related to subprime mortgage lending.\\n\\r\\n       Promoting access to credit and to homeownership are important objectives, and responsible subprime mortgage lending can help advance both goals.\\xa0 In designing regulations, policymakers should seek to preserve those benefits.\\xa0 That said, the recent rapid expansion of the subprime market was clearly accompanied by deterioration in underwriting standards and, in some cases, by abusive lending practices and outright fraud.\\xa0 In addition, some households took on mortgage obligations they could not meet, perhaps in some cases because they did not fully understand the terms.\\xa0 Financial losses have subsequently induced lenders to tighten their underwriting standards.\\xa0 Nevertheless, rising delinquencies and foreclosures are creating personal, economic, and social distress for many homeowners and communities--problems that likely will get worse before they get better.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve is responding to these difficulties at both the national and the local levels.\\xa0 In coordination with the other federal supervisory agencies, we are encouraging the financial industry to work with borrowers to arrange prudent loan modifications to avoid unnecessary foreclosures.\\xa0 Federal Reserve Banks around the country are cooperating with community and industry groups that work directly with borrowers having trouble meeting their mortgage obligations.\\xa0 We continue to work with organizations that provide counseling about mortgage products to current and potential homeowners.\\xa0 We are also meeting with market participants--including lenders, investors, servicers, and community groups--to discuss their concerns and to gain information about market developments.\\n\\r\\n       We are conducting a top-to-bottom review of possible actions we might take to help prevent recurrence of these problems.\\xa0 First, we are committed to providing more-effective disclosures to help consumers defend against improper lending.\\xa0 Three years ago, the Board began a comprehensive review of Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).\\xa0 The initial focus of our review was on disclosures related to credit cards and other revolving credit accounts.\\xa0 After conducting extensive consumer testing, we issued a proposal in May that would require credit card issuers to provide clearer and easier-to-understand disclosures to customers.\\xa0 In particular, the new disclosures would highlight applicable rates and fees, particularly penalties that might be imposed.\\xa0 The proposed rules would also require card issuers to provide forty-five days' advance notice of a rate increase or any other change in account terms so that consumers will not be surprised by unexpected charges and will have time to explore alternatives.\\n\\r\\n       We are now engaged in a similar review of the TILA rules for mortgage loans.\\xa0 We began this review last year by holding four public hearings across the country, during which we gathered information on the adequacy of disclosures for mortgages, particularly for nontraditional and adjustable-rate products.\\xa0 As we did with credit card lending, we will conduct extensive consumer testing of proposed disclosures.\\xa0 Because the process of designing and testing disclosures involves many trial runs, especially given today's diverse and sometimes complex credit products, it may take some time to complete our review and propose new disclosures.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       However, some other actions can be implemented more quickly.\\xa0 By the end of the year, we will propose changes to TILA rules to address concerns about mortgage loan advertisements and solicitations that may be incomplete or misleading and to require lenders to provide mortgage disclosures more quickly so that consumers can get the information they need when it is most useful to them.\\xa0 We already have improved a disclosure that creditors must provide to every applicant for an adjustable-rate mortgage product to explain better the features and risks of these products, such as “payment shock” and rising loan balances.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We are certainly aware, however, that disclosure alone may not be sufficient to protect consumers.\\xa0 Accordingly, we plan to exercise our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) to address specific practices that are unfair or deceptive.\\xa0 We held a public hearing on June 14 to discuss industry practices, including those pertaining to pre-payment penalties, the use of escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated-income and low-documentation lending, and the evaluation of a borrower's ability to repay.\\xa0 The discussion and ideas we heard were extremely useful, and we look forward to receiving additional public comments in coming weeks.\\xa0 Based on the information we are gathering, I expect that the Board will propose additional rules under HOEPA later this year.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       In coordination with the other federal supervisory agencies, last year we issued principles-based guidance on nontraditional mortgages, and in June of this year we issued supervisory guidance on subprime lending.\\xa0 These statements emphasize the fundamental consumer protection principles of sound underwriting and effective disclosures.\\xa0 In addition, we reviewed our policies related to the examination of nonbank subsidiaries of bank and financial holding companies for compliance with consumer protection laws and guidance.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       As a result of that review and following discussions with the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and state regulators, as represented by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, we are launching a cooperative pilot project aimed at expanding consumer protection compliance reviews at selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime mortgage operations.\\xa0 The reviews will begin in the fourth quarter of this year and will include independent state-licensed mortgage lenders, nondepository mortgage lending subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with or serving as agents of these entities.\\xa0 The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of and improved enforcement for nondepository mortgage lenders.\\xa0 Working together to address jurisdictional issues and to improve information-sharing among agencies, we will seek to prevent abusive and fraudulent lending while ensuring that consumers retain access to beneficial credit.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       I believe that the actions I have described today will help address the current problems.\\xa0 The Federal Reserve

I look forward to working closely with the members of this Committee on issues of monetary policy as well as on matters regarding the other responsibilities with which the Congress has charged the Federal Reserve System. \\nThe U.S. economy performed impressively in 2005. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased a bit more than 3 percent, building on the sustained expansion that gained traction in the middle of 2003. Payroll employment rose 2 million in 2005, and the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent. Productivity continued to advance briskly. \\nThe economy achieved these gains despite some significant obstacles. Energy prices rose substantially yet again, in response to increasing global demand, hurricane-related disruptions to production, and concerns about the adequacy and reliability of supply. The Gulf Coast region suffered through severe hurricanes that inflicted a terrible loss of life; destroyed homes, personal property, businesses, and infrastructure on a massive scale; and displaced more than a million people. The storms also damaged facilities and disrupted production in many industries, with substantial effects on the energy and petrochemical sectors and on the region's ports. Full recovery in the affected areas is likely to be slow. The hurricanes left an imprint on aggregate economic activity as well, seen, in part, in the marked deceleration of real GDP in the fourth quarter. However, the most recent evidence--including indicators of production, the flow of new orders to businesses, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance, and the payroll employment and retail sales figures for January--suggests that the economic expansion remains on track. \\nInflation pressures increased in 2005. Steeply rising energy prices pushed up overall inflation, raised business costs, and squeezed household budgets. Nevertheless, the increase in prices for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, at just below 2 percent, remained moderate, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to have been contained. \\nWith the economy expanding at a solid pace, resource utilization rising, cost pressures increasing, and short-term interest rates still relatively low, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) over the course of 2005 continued the process of removing monetary policy accommodation, raising the federal funds rate 2 percentage points in eight increments of 25 basis points each. At its meeting on January 31 of this year, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate another 1/4 percentage point, bringing its level to 4-1/2 percent. \\nAt that meeting¸ monetary policymakers also discussed the economic outlook for the next two years. The central tendency of the forecasts of members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks is for real GDP to increase about 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent in 2007. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 at a level between 4-3/4 percent and 5 percent. Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, is predicted to be about 2 percent this year and 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent next year. While considerable uncertainty surrounds any economic forecast extending nearly two years, I am comfortable with these projections. \\nIn the announcement following the January 31 meeting, the Federal Reserve pointed to risks that could add to inflation pressures. Among those risks is the possibility that, to an extent greater than we now anticipate, higher energy prices may pass through into the prices of non-energy goods and services or have a persistent effect on inflation expectations. Another factor bearing on the inflation outlook is that the economy now appears to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization. Gauging the economy's sustainable potential is difficult, and the Federal Reserve will keep a close eye on all the relevant evidence and be flexible in making those judgments. Nevertheless, the risk exists that, with aggregate demand exhibiting considerable momentum, output could overshoot its sustainable path, leading ultimately--in the absence of countervailing monetary policy action--to further upward pressure on inflation. In these circumstances, the FOMC judged that some further firming of monetary policy may be necessary, an assessment with which I concur. \\nNot all of the risks to the economy concern inflation. For example, a number of indicators point to a slowing in the housing market. Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth of overall economic activity. However, given the substantial gains in house prices and the high levels of home construction activity over the past several years, prices and construction could decelerate more rapidly than currently seems likely. Slower growth in home equity, in turn, might lead households to boost their saving and trim their spending relative to current income by more than is now anticipated. The possibility of significant further increases in energy prices represents an additional risk to the economy; besides affecting inflation, such increases might also hurt consumer confidence and thereby reduce spending on non-energy goods and services. \\nAlthough the outlook contains significant uncertainties, it is clear that substantial progress has been made in removing monetary policy accommodation. As a consequence, in coming quarters the FOMC will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy actions will be increasingly dependent on incoming data. \\nIn assessing the prospects for the economy, some appreciation of recent circumstances is essential, so let me now review key developments of 2005 and discuss their implications for the outlook. The household sector was a mainstay of the economic expansion again last year, and household spending is likely to remain an important source of growth in aggregate demand in 2006. The growth in household spending last year was supported by rising employment and moderate increases in wages. Expenditures were buoyed as well by significant gains in household wealth that reflected further increases in home values and in broad equity prices. However, sharply rising bills for gasoline and heating reduced the amount of income available for spending on other consumer goods and services. \\nResidential investment also expanded considerably in 2005, supported by a strong real estate market. However, as I have already noted, some signs of slowing in the housing market have appeared in recent months: Home sales have softened, the inventory of unsold homes has risen, and indicators of homebuilder and homebuyer sentiment have turned down. Anecdotal information suggests that homes typically are on the market somewhat longer than they were a year or so ago, and the frequency of contract offers above asking prices reportedly has diminished. Financial market conditions seem to be consistent with some moderation in housing activity. Interest rates on thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which were around 5-3/4 percent over much of 2005, rose noticeably in the final months of the year to their current level of around 6-1/4 percent. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages have climbed more considerably. Still, despite the recent increases, mortgage rates remain relatively low. Low mortgage rates, together with expanding payrolls and incomes and the need to rebuild after the hurricanes, should continue to support the housing market. Thus, at this point, a leveling out or a modest softening of housing activity seems more likely than a sharp contraction, although significant uncertainty attends the outlook for home prices and construction. In any case, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor this sector closely. \\nOverall, the financial health of households appears reasonably good. Largely reflecting the growth in home mortgages, total household debt continued to expand rapidly in 2005. But the value of household assets also continued to climb strongly, driven by gains in home prices and equity shares. To some extent, sizable increases in household wealth, as well as low interest rates, have contributed in recent years to the low level of personal saving. Saving last year was probably further depressed by the rise in households' energy bills. Over the next few years, saving relative to income is likely to rise somewhat from its recent low level. \\nIn the business sector, profits continued to rise last year at a solid pace, boosted in part by continuing advances in productivity. Strong corporate balance sheets combined with expanding sales and favorable conditions in financial markets fostered a solid increase in spending on equipment and software last year. Investment in high-tech equipment rebounded, its increase spurred by further declines in the prices of high-tech goods. Expenditures for communications equipment, which had fallen off earlier this decade, showed particular strength for the year as a whole. In contrast, nonresidential construction activity remained soft. \\nAlthough the financial condition of the business sector is generally quite strong, several areas of structural weakness are evident, notably in the automobile and airline industries. Despite these problems, however, favorable conditions in the business sector as a whole should encourage continued expansion of capital investment. \\nFor the most part, the financial situation of state and local governments has improved noticeably over the past couple of years. Rising personal and business incomes have buoyed tax revenues, affording some scope for increases in state and local government expenditures. At the federal level, the budget deficit narrowed appreciably in fiscal 2005. Outlays rose rapidly, but receipts climbed even more sharply as the economy expanded. However, defense expenditures, hurricane relief, and increasing entitlement costs seem likely to worsen the deficit in fiscal 2006. \\nOutside the United States, economic activity strengthened last year, and at present global growth seems to be on a good track. The economies of our North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico, appear to be expanding at a solid pace. Especially significant have been signs that Japan could be emerging from its protracted slump and its battle with deflation. In the euro area, expansion has been somewhat modest by global standards, but recent indicators suggest that growth could be strengthening there as well. Economies in emerging Asia generally continue to expand strongly. In particular, growth in China remained vigorous in 2005. \\nExpanding foreign economic activity helped drive a vigorous advance in U.S. exports in 2005, while the growth of real imports slowed. Nonetheless, the nominal U.S. trade deficit increased further last year, exacerbated in part by a jump in the value of imported petroleum products that almost wholly reflected the sharply rising price of crude oil. \\nSurging energy prices also were the dominant factor influencing U.S. inflation last year. For the second year in a row, overall consumer prices, as measured by the chain-type index for personal consumption expenditures, rose about 3 percent. Prices of consumer energy products jumped more than 20 percent, with large increases in prices of natural gas, gasoline, and fuel oil. Food prices, however, rose only modestly. And core consumer prices (that is, excluding food and energy) increased a moderate 1.9 percent. \\nThe relatively benign performance of core inflation despite the steep increases in energy prices can be attributed to several factors. Over the past few decades, the U.S. economy has become significantly less energy intensive. Also, rapid advances in productivity as well as increases in nominal wages and salaries that, on balance, have been moderate have restrained unit labor costs in recent years. \\nAnother key factor in keeping core inflation low has been confidence on the part of the public and investors in the prospects for price stability. Maintaining expectations of low and stable inflation is an essential element in the Federal Reserve's effort to promote price stability. And, thus far, the news has been good: Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have responded only a little to the larger fluctuations in energy prices that we have experienced, and for the most part, they were low and stable last year. Inflation compensation for the period five to ten years ahead, derived from spreads between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities, has remained well anchored. \\nRestrained inflation expectations have also been an important reason that long-term interest rates have remained relatively low. At roughly 4-1/2 percent at year-end, yields on ten-year nominal Treasury issues increased only slightly on balance over 2005 even as short-term rates rose 2 percentage points. As previous reports and testimonies from the Federal Reserve indicated, a decomposition of long-term nominal yields into spot and forward rates suggests that it is primarily the far-forward components that account for the low level of long rates. The premiums that investors demand as compensation for the risk of unforeseen changes in real interest rates and inflation appear to have declined significantly over the past decade or so. Given the more stable macroeconomic climate in the United States and in the global economy since the mid-1980s, some decline in risk premiums is not surprising. In addition, though, investors seem to expect real interest rates to remain relatively low. Such a view is consistent with a hypothesis I offered last year--that, in recent years, an excess of desired global saving over the quantity of global investment opportunities that pay historically normal returns has forced down the real interest rate prevailing in global capital markets. \\nInflation prospects are important, not just because price stability is in itself desirable and part of the Federal Reserve's mandate from the Congress, but also because price stability is essential for strong and stable growth of output and employment. Stable prices promote long-term economic growth by allowing households and firms to make economic decisions and undertake productive activities with fewer concerns about large or unanticipated changes in the price level and their attendant financial consequences. Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability in output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy. Similarly, the attainment of the statutory goal of moderate long-term interest rates requires price stability, because only then are the inflation premiums that investors demand for holding long-term instruments kept to a minimum. In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; it is also central to attaining the Federal Reserve's other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long-term interest rates. \\nAs always, however, translating the Federal Reserve's general economic objectives into operational decisions about the stance of monetary policy poses many challenges. Over the past few decades, policymakers have learned that no single economic or financial indicator, or even a small set of such indicators, can provide reliable guidance for the setting of monetary policy. \\nRather, the Federal Reserve, together with all modern central banks, has found that the successful conduct of monetary policy requires painstaking examination of a broad range of economic and financial data, careful consideration of the implications of those data for the likely path of the economy and inflation, and prudent judgment regarding the effects of alternative courses of policy action on prospects for achieving our macroeconomic objectives. In that process, economic models can provide valuable guidance to policymakers, and over the years substantial progress has been made in developing formal models and forecasting techniques. But any model is by necessity a simplification of the real world, and sufficient data are seldom available to measure even the basic relationships with precision. Monetary policymakers must therefore strike a difficult balance--conducting rigorous analysis informed by sound economic theory and empirical methods while keeping an open mind about the many factors, including myriad global influences, at play in a dynamic modern economy like that of the United States. Amid significant uncertainty, we must formulate a view of the most likely course of the economy under a given policy approach while giving due weight to the potential risks and associated costs to the economy should those judgments turn out to be wrong. \\nDuring the nearly three years that I previously spent as a member of the Board of Governors and of the Federal Open Market Committee, the approach to policy that I have just outlined was standard operating procedure under the highly successful leadership of Chairman Greenspan. As I indicated to the Congress during my confirmation hearing, my intention is to maintain continuity with this and the other practices of the Federal Reserve in the Greenspan era. I believe that, with this approach, the Federal Reserve will continue to contribute to the sound performance of the U.S. economy in the years to come. \\nFebruary 2006 Monetary policy report \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\n\\n\\nCongressional Hearing Transcripts\\nHearing transcripts are posted to this website as they become available.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Top\\n\\nLast Update:\\r\\n                February 15, 2006\\r\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\\n\\nAbout the FedNews & EventsMonetary PolicySupervision & RegulationFinancial StabilityPayment SystemsEconomic ResearchDataConsumers & CommunitiesLinktree\\n\\n\\n\\nTools and Information\\n\\nContact\\nPublications\\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\\nOffice of Inspector General\\nBudget & Performance | Audit\\nNo FEAR Act\\nEspañol\\nWebsite Policies  | Privacy Program\\nAccessibility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStay Connected\\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page\\nFederal Reserve Instagram Page\\nFederal Reserve YouTube Page\\nFederal Reserve Flickr Page\\nFederal Reserve LinkedIn Page\\nFederal Reserve Threads Page\\nLink to Federal Reserve Twitter Page\\nSubscribe to RSS\\nSubscribe to Email\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSemiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress -

Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter of 2006. The available indicators suggest that economic growth has more recently moderated from that quite strong pace, reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and other factors that I will discuss. With respect to the labor market, more than 850,000 jobs were added, on net, to nonfarm payrolls over the first six months of the year, though these gains came at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first. Last month the unemployment rate stood at 4.6 percent.\\nInflation has been higher than we had anticipated in February, partly as a result of further sharp increases in the prices of energy and other commodities. During the first five months of the year, overall inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures averaged 4.3 percent at an annual rate. Over the same period, core inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices--averaged 2.6 percent at an annual rate. To address the risk that inflation pressures might remain elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continued to firm the stance of monetary policy, raising the federal funds rate another 3/4 percentage point, to 5-1/4 percent, in the period since our last report.\\nLet me now review the current economic situation and the outlook in a bit more detail, beginning with developments in the real economy and then turning to the inflation situation. I will conclude with some comments on monetary policy.\\nThe U.S. economy appears to be in a period of transition. For the past three years or so, economic growth in the United States has been robust. This growth has reflected both the ongoing re-employment of underutilized resources, as the economy recovered from the weakness of earlier in the decade, and the expansion of the economy\\'s underlying productive potential, as determined by such factors as productivity trends and growth of the labor force. Although the rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain cannot be known with any precision, it is clear that, after several years of above-trend growth, slack in resource utilization has been substantially reduced. As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve a modest reduction in the growth of economic activity from the rapid pace of the past three years to a pace more consistent with the rate of increase in the nation\\'s underlying productive capacity. It bears emphasizing that, because productivity growth seems likely to remain strong, the productive capacity of our economy should expand over the next few years at a rate sufficient to support solid growth in real output.\\nAs I have noted, the anticipated moderation in economic growth now seems to be under way, although the recent erratic growth pattern complicates this assessment. That moderation appears most evident in the household sector. In particular, consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of aggregate spending, grew rapidly during the first quarter but decelerated during the spring. One likely source of this deceleration was higher energy prices, which have adversely affected the purchasing power of households and weighed on consumer attitudes.\\nOutlays for residential construction, which have been at very high levels in recent years, rose further in the first quarter. More recently, however, the market for residential real estate has been cooling, as can be seen in the slowing of new and existing home sales and housing starts. Some of the recent softening in housing starts may have resulted from the unusually favorable weather during the first quarter of the year, which pulled forward construction activity, but the slowing of the housing market appears to be more broad-based than can be explained by that factor alone. Home prices, which have climbed at double-digit rates in recent years, still appear to be rising for the nation as a whole, though significantly less rapidly than before. These developments in the housing market are not particularly surprising, as the sustained run-up in housing prices, together with some increase in mortgage rates, has reduced affordability and thus the demand for new homes.\\nThe slowing of the housing market may restrain other forms of household spending as well. With homeowners no longer experiencing increases in the equity value of their homes at the rapid pace seen in the past few years, and with the recent declines in stock prices, increases in household net worth are likely to provide less of a boost to consumer expenditures than they have in the recent past. That said, favorable fundamentals, including relatively low unemployment and rising disposable incomes, should provide support for consumer spending. Overall, household expenditures appear likely to expand at a moderate pace, providing continued impetus to the overall economic expansion. \\nAlthough growth in household spending has slowed, other sectors of the economy retain considerable momentum. Business investment in new capital goods appears to have risen briskly, on net, so far this year. In particular, investment in nonresidential structures, which had been weak since 2001, seems to have picked up appreciably, providing some offset to the slower growth in residential construction. Spending on equipment and software has also been strong. With a few exceptions, business inventories appear to be well aligned with sales, which reduces the risk that a buildup of unwanted inventories might act to reduce production in the future. Business investment seems likely to continue to grow at a solid pace, supported by growth in final sales, rising backlogs of orders for capital goods, and high rates of profitability. To be sure, businesses in certain sectors have experienced financial difficulties. In the aggregate, however, firms remain in excellent financial condition, and credit conditions for businesses are favorable.\\nGlobally, output growth appears strong. Growth of the global economy will help support U.S. economic activity by continuing to stimulate demand for our exports of goods and services. One downside of the strength of the global economy, however, is that it has led to significant increases in the demand for crude oil and other primary commodities over the past few years. Together with heightened geopolitical uncertainties and the limited ability of suppliers to expand capacity in the short run, these rising demands have resulted in sharp rises in the prices at which those goods are traded internationally, which in turn has put upward pressure on costs and prices in the United States.\\nOverall, the U.S. economy seems poised to grow in coming quarters at a pace roughly in line with the expansion of its underlying productive capacity. Such an outlook is embodied in the projections of members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks that were made around the time of the FOMC meeting late last month, based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. In particular, the central tendency of those forecasts is for real GDP to increase about 3-1/4 percent to 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3-1/4 percent in 2007. With output expanding at a pace near that of the economy\\'s potential, the civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 between 4-3/4 percent and 5 percent, close to its recent level.\\nI turn now to the inflation situation. As I noted, inflation has been higher than we expected at the time of our last report. Much of the upward pressure on overall inflation this year has been due to increases in the prices of energy and other commodities and, in particular, to the higher prices of products derived from crude oil. Gasoline prices have increased notably as a result of the rise in petroleum prices as well as factors specific to the market for ethanol. The pickup in inflation so far this year has also been reflected in the prices of a range of non-energy goods and services, as strengthening demand may have given firms more ability to pass energy and other costs through to consumers. In addition, increases in residential rents, as well as in the imputed rent on owner-occupied homes, have recently contributed to higher core inflation.\\nThe recent rise in inflation is of concern to the FOMC. The achievement of price stability is one of the objectives that make up the Congress\\'s mandate to the Federal Reserve. Moreover, in the long run, price stability is critical to achieving maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, the other parts of the congressional mandate.\\nThe outlook for inflation is shaped by a number of factors, not the least of which is the course of energy prices. The spot price of oil has moved up significantly further in recent weeks. Futures quotes imply that market participants expect petroleum prices to roughly stabilize in coming quarters; such an outcome would, over time, reduce one source of upward pressure on inflation. However, expectations of a leveling out of oil prices have been consistently disappointed in recent years, and as the experience of the past week suggests, possible increases in these and other commodity prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook.\\nAlthough the costs of energy and other raw materials are important, labor costs are by far the largest component of business costs. Anecdotal reports suggest that the labor market is tight in some industries and occupations and that employers are having difficulty attracting certain types of skilled workers. To date, however, moderate growth in most broad measures of nominal labor compensation and the ongoing increases in labor productivity have held down the rise in unit labor costs, reducing pressure on inflation from the cost side. Employee compensation per hour is likely to rise more quickly over the next couple of years in response to the strength of the labor market. Whether faster increases in nominal compensation create additional cost pressures for firms depends in part on the extent to which they are offset by continuing productivity gains. Profit margins are currently relatively wide, and the effect of a possible acceleration in compensation on price inflation would thus also depend on the extent to which competitive pressures force firms to reduce margins rather than pass on higher costs.\\nThe public\\'s inflation expectations are another important determinant of inflation. The Federal Reserve must guard against the emergence of an inflationary psychology that could impart greater persistence to what would otherwise be a transitory increase in inflation. After rising earlier this year, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, based on surveys and on a comparison of yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt, have edged down and remain contained. These developments bear watching, however.\\nFinally, the extent to which aggregate demand is aligned with the economy\\'s underlying productive potential also influences inflation. As I noted earlier, FOMC participants project that the growth in economic activity should moderate to a pace close to that of the growth of potential both this year and next. Should that moderation occur as anticipated, it should help to limit inflation pressures over time.\\nThe projections of the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, which are based on information available at the time of the last FOMC meeting, are for a gradual decline in inflation in coming quarters. As measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, inflation is projected to be 2-1/4 percent to 2-1/2 percent this year and then to edge lower, to 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent next year.\\nThe FOMC projections, which now anticipate slightly lower growth in real output and higher core inflation than expected in our February report, mirror the somewhat more adverse circumstances facing our economy, which have resulted from the recent steep run-up in energy costs and higher-than-expected inflation more generally. But they also reflect our assessment that, with appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of significant unforeseen developments, the economy should continue to expand at a solid and sustainable pace and core inflation should decline from its recent level over the medium term.\\nAlthough our baseline forecast is for moderating inflation, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. In particular, the high prices of energy and other commodities, in conjunction with high levels of resource utilization that may increase the pricing power of suppliers of goods and services, have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. More generally, if the pattern of elevated readings on inflation is more protracted or more intense than is currently expected, this higher level of inflation could become embedded in the public\\'s inflation expectations and in price-setting behavior. Persistently higher inflation would erode the performance of the real economy and would be costly to reverse. The Federal Reserve must take account of these risks in making its policy decisions.\\nIn our pursuit of maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy makers operate in an environment of uncertainty. In particular, we have imperfect knowledge about the effects of our own policy actions as well as of the many other factors that will shape economic developments during the forecast period. These uncertainties bear importantly on our policy decisions because the full influence of policy actions on the economy is felt only after a considerable period of time. The lags between policy actions and their effects imply that we must be forward-looking, basing our policy choices on the longer-term outlook for both inflation and economic growth. In formulating that outlook, we must take account of the possible future effects of previous policy actions--that is, of policy effects still \"in the pipeline.\" Finally, as I have noted, we must consider not only what appears to be the most likely outcome but also the risks to that outlook and the costs that would be incurred should any of those risks be realized. \\nAt the same time, because economic forecasting is far from a precise science, we have no choice but to regard all our forecasts as provisional and subject to revision as the facts demand. Thus, policy must be flexible and ready to adjust to changes in economic projections. In particular, as the Committee noted in the statement issued after its June meeting, the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address inflation risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by our analysis of the incoming information.\\nThank you.

In the seven months since I last testified before this Committee, the U.S. economic expansion has firmed, overall inflation has subsided, and core inflation has remained low. \\nOver the first half of 2004, the available information increasingly suggested that the economic expansion was becoming less fragile and that the risk of an undesirable decline in inflation had greatly diminished.  Toward midyear, the Federal Reserve came to the judgment that the extraordinary degree of policy accommodation that had been in place since the middle of 2003 was no longer warranted and, in the announcement released at the conclusion of our May meeting, signaled that a firming of policy was likely.  The Federal Open Market Committee began to raise the federal funds rate at its June meeting, and the announcement following that meeting indicated the need for further, albeit gradual, withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus.\\n \\tAround the same time, incoming data suggested a lull in activity as the economy absorbed the impact of higher energy prices.  Much as had been expected, this soft patch proved to be short-lived.  Accordingly, the Federal Reserve has followed the June policy move with similar actions at each meeting since then, including our most recent meeting earlier this month.  The cumulative removal of policy accommodation to date has significantly raised measures of the real federal funds rate, but by most measures, it remains fairly low. \\r\\n\\nThe evidence broadly supports the view that economic fundamentals have steadied.  Consumer spending has been well maintained over recent months, buoyed by continued growth in disposable personal income, gains in net worth, and accommodative conditions in credit markets.  Households have recorded a modest improvement in their financial position over this period, to the betterment of many indicators of credit quality.  Low interest rates and rising incomes have contributed to a decline in the aggregate household financial obligation ratio, and delinquency and charge-off rates on various categories of consumer loans have stayed at low levels.\\nThe sizable gains in consumer spending of recent years have been accompanied by a drop in the personal saving rate to an average of only 1 percent over 2004--a very low figure relative to the nearly 7 percent rate averaged over the previous three decades.  Among the factors contributing to the strength of spending and the decline in saving have been developments in housing markets and home finance that have spurred rising household wealth and allowed greater access to that wealth.  The rapid rise in home prices over the past several years has provided households with considerable capital gains.  Moreover, a significant increase in the rate of single-family home turnover has meant that many consumers have been able to realize gains from the sale of their homes.  To be sure, such capital gains, largely realized through an increase in mortgage debt on the home, do not increase the pool of national savings available to finance new capital investment.  But from the perspective of an individual household, cash realized from capital gains has the same spending power as cash from any other source. \\n \\tMore broadly, rising home prices along with higher equity prices have outpaced the rise in household, largely mortgage, debt and have pushed up household net worth to about 5-1/2 times disposable income by the end of last year.  Although the ratio of net worth to income is well below the peak attained in 1999, it remains above the long-term historical average.  These gains in net worth help to explain why households in the aggregate do not appear uncomfortable with their financial position even though their reported personal saving rate is negligible.  \\nOf course, household net worth may not continue to rise relative to income, and some reversal in that ratio is not out of the question.  If that were to occur, households would probably perceive the need to save more out of current income; the personal saving rate would accordingly rise, and consumer spending would slow.  \\nBut while household spending may well play a smaller role in the expansion going forward, business executives apparently have become somewhat more optimistic in recent months.  Capital spending and corporate borrowing have firmed noticeably, but some of the latter may have been directed to finance the recent backup in inventories.  Mergers and acquisitions, though, have clearly perked up.\\nEven in the current much-improved environment, however, some caution among business executives remains.  Although capital investment has been advancing at a reasonably good pace, it has nonetheless lagged the exceptional rise in profits and internal cash flow.  This is most unusual; it took a deep recession to produce the last such configuration in 1975.  The lingering caution evident in capital spending decisions has also been manifest in less-aggressive hiring by businesses.  In contrast to the typical pattern early in previous business-cycle recoveries, firms have appeared reluctant to take on new workers and have remained focused on cost containment.\\nAs opposed to the lingering hesitancy among business executives, participants in financial markets seem very confident about the future and, judging by the exceptionally low level of risk spreads in credit markets, quite willing to bear risk.  This apparent disparity in sentiment between business people and market participants could reflect the heightened additional concerns of business executives about potential legal liabilities rather than a fundamentally different assessment of macroeconomic risks.    \\nTurning to the outlook for costs and prices, productivity developments will likely play a key role.  The growth of output per hour slowed over the past half year, giving a boost to unit labor costs after two years of declines.  Going forward, the implications for inflation will be influenced by the extent and persistence of any slowdown in productivity.  A lower rate of productivity growth in the context of relatively stable increases in average hourly compensation has led to slightly more rapid growth in unit labor costs.  Whether inflation actually rises in the wake of slowing productivity growth, however, will depend on the rate of growth of labor compensation and the ability and willingness of firms to pass on higher costs to their customers.  That, in turn, will depend on the degree of utilization of resources and how monetary policymakers respond.  To date, with profit margins already high, competitive pressures have tended to limit the extent to which cost pressures have been reflected in higher prices.\\nProductivity is notoriously difficult to predict.  Neither the large surge in output per hour from the first quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2004, nor the more recent moderation was easy to anticipate.  It seems likely that these swings reflected delayed efficiency gains from the capital goods boom of the 1990s.  Throughout the first half of last year, businesses were able to meet increasing orders with management efficiencies rather than new hires.  But conceivably the backlog of untapped total efficiencies has run low, requiring new hires.  Indeed, new hires as a percent of employment rose in the fourth quarter of last year to the highest level since the second quarter of 2001.  \\t\\nThere is little question that the potential remains for large advances in productivity from further applications of existing knowledge, and insights into applications not even now contemplated doubtless will emerge in the years ahead.  However, we have scant ability to infer the pace at which such gains will play out and, therefore, their implications for the growth of productivity over the longer run.  It is, of course, the rate of change of productivity over time, and not its level, that influences the persistent changes in unit labor costs and hence the rate of inflation.\\nThe inflation outlook will also be shaped by developments affecting the exchange value of the dollar and oil prices.  Although the dollar has been declining since early 2002, exporters to the United States apparently have held dollar prices relatively steady to preserve their market share, effectively choosing to absorb the decline in the dollar by accepting a reduction in their profit margins.  However, the recent somewhat quickened pace of increases in U.S. import prices suggests that profit margins of exporters to the United States have contracted to the point where the foreign shippers may exhibit only limited tolerance for additional reductions in margins should the dollar decline further.  \\nThe sharp rise in oil prices over the past year has no doubt boosted firms' costs and may have weighed on production, particularly given the sizable permanent component of oil price increases suggested by distant-horizon oil futures contracts.  However, the share of total business expenses attributable to energy costs has declined appreciably over the past thirty years, which has helped to buffer profits and the economy more generally from the adverse effect of high oil and natural gas prices.  Still, although the aggregate effect may be modest, we must recognize that some sectors of the economy and regions of the country have been hit hard by the increase in energy costs, especially over the past year.\\nDespite the combination of somewhat slower growth of productivity in recent quarters, higher energy prices, and a decline in the exchange rate for the dollar, core measures of consumer prices have registered only modest increases.  The core PCE and CPI measures, for example, climbed about 1-1/4 and 2 percent, respectively, at an annual rate over the second half of last year.\\nAll told, the economy seems to have entered 2005 expanding at a reasonably good pace, with inflation and inflation expectations well anchored.  On the whole, financial markets appear to share this view.  In particular, a broad array of financial indicators convey a pervasive sense of confidence among investors and an associated greater willingness to bear risk than is yet evident among business managers.\\nBoth realized and option-implied measures of uncertainty in equity and fixed-income markets have declined markedly over recent months to quite low levels.  Credit spreads, read from corporate bond yields and credit default swap premiums, have continued to narrow amid widespread signs of an improvement in corporate credit quality, including notable drops in corporate bond defaults and debt ratings downgrades.  Moreover, recent surveys suggest that bank lending officers have further eased standards and terms on business loans, and anecdotal reports suggest that securities dealers and other market-makers appear quite willing to commit capital in providing market liquidity.\\nIn this environment, long-term interest rates have trended lower in recent months even as the Federal Reserve has raised the level of the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points.  This development contrasts with most experience, which suggests that, other things being equal, increasing short-term interest rates are normally accompanied by a rise in longer-term yields.  The simple mathematics of the yield curve governs the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates.  Ten-year yields, for example, can be thought of as an average of ten consecutive one-year forward rates.  A rise in the first-year forward rate, which correlates closely with the federal funds rate, would increase the yield on ten-year U.S. Treasury notes even if the more-distant forward rates remain unchanged.  Historically, though, even these distant forward rates have tended to rise in association with monetary policy tightening.\\nIn the current episode, however, the more-distant forward rates declined at the same time that short-term rates were rising.  Indeed, the tenth-year tranche, which yielded 6-1/2 percent last June, is now at about 5-1/4 percent.  During the same period, comparable real forward rates derived from quotes on Treasury inflation-indexed debt fell significantly as well, suggesting that only a portion of the decline in nominal forward rates in distant tranches is attributable to a drop in long-term inflation expectations.\\nSome analysts have worried that the dip in forward real interest rates since last June may indicate that market participants have marked down their view of economic growth going forward, perhaps because of the rise in oil prices.  But this interpretation does not mesh seamlessly with the rise in stock prices and the narrowing of credit spreads observed over the same interval.  Others have emphasized the subdued overall business demand for credit in the United States and the apparent eagerness of lenders, including foreign investors, to provide financing.  In particular, heavy purchases of longer-term Treasury securities by foreign central banks have often been cited as a factor boosting bond prices and pulling down longer-term yields.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage rates have dropped to a level only a little higher than the record lows touched in 2003 and, as a consequence, the estimated average duration of outstanding mortgage-backed securities has shortened appreciably over recent months.  Attempts by mortgage investors to offset this decline in duration by purchasing longer-term securities may be yet another contributor to the recent downward pressure on longer-term yields.\\nBut we should be careful in endeavoring to account for the decline in long-term interest rates by adverting to technical factors in the United States alone because yields and risk spreads have narrowed globally.  The German ten-year Bund rate, for example, has declined from 4-1/4 percent last June to current levels of 3-1/2 percent.  And spreads of yields on bonds issued by emerging-market nations over U.S. Treasury yields have declined to very low levels.\\nThere is little doubt that, with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the integration of China and India into the global trading market, more of the world's productive capacity is being tapped to satisfy global demands for goods and services.  Concurrently, greater integration of financial markets has meant that a larger share of the world's pool of savings is being deployed in cross-border financing of investment.  The favorable inflation performance across a broad range of countries resulting from enlarged global goods, services and financial capacity has doubtless contributed to expectations of lower inflation in the years ahead and lower inflation risk premiums.  But none of this is new and hence it is difficult to attribute the long-term interest rate declines of the last nine months to glacially increasing globalization.  For the moment, the broadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains a conundrum.  Bond price movements may be a short-term aberration, but it will be some time before we are able to better judge the forces underlying recent experience.\\nThis is but one of many uncertainties that will confront world policymakers.  Over the past two decades, the industrial world has fended off two severe stock market corrections, a major financial crisis in developing nations, corporate scandals, and, of course, the tragedy of September 11, 2001.  Yet overall economic activity experienced only modest difficulties.  In the United States, only five quarters in the past twenty years exhibited declines in GDP, and those declines were small.  Thus, it is not altogether unexpected or irrational that participants in the world marketplace would project more of the same going forward.\\nYet history cautions that people experiencing long periods of relative stability are prone to excess.  We must thus remain vigilant against complacency, especially since several important economic challenges confront policymakers in the years ahead.\\nProminent among these challenges in the United States is the pressing need to maintain the flexibility of our economic and financial system.  This will be essential if we are to address our current account deficit without significant disruption.  Besides market pressures, which appear poised to stabilize and over the longer run possibly to decrease the U.S. current account deficit and its attendant financing requirements, some forces in the domestic U.S. economy seem about to head in the same direction.  Central to that adjustment must be an increase in net national saving.  This serves to underscore the imperative to restore fiscal discipline.\\nBeyond the near term, benefits promised to a burgeoning retirement-age population under mandatory entitlement programs, most notably Social Security and Medicare, threaten to strain the resources of the working-age population in the years ahead.  Real progress on these issues will unavoidably entail many difficult choices.  But the demographics are inexorable, and call for action before the leading edge of baby boomer retirement becomes evident in 2008.  This is especially the case because longer-term problems, if not addressed, could begin to affect longer-dated debt issues, the value of which is based partly on expectations of developments many years in the future.\\nAnother critical long-run economic challenge facing the United States is the need to ensure that our workforce is equipped with the requisite skills to compete effectively in an environment of rapid technological progress and global competition.  Technological advance is continually altering the shape, nature, and complexity of our economic processes.  But technology and, more recently, competition from abroad have grown to a point at which demand for the least-skilled workers in the United States and other developed countries is diminishing, placing downward pressure on their wages.  These workers will need to acquire the skills required to compete effectively for the new jobs that our economy will create.\\nAt the risk of some oversimplification, if the skill composition of our workforce meshed fully with the needs of our increasingly complex capital stock, wage-skill differentials would be stable, and percentage changes in wage rates would be the same for all job grades.  But for the past twenty years, the supply of skilled, particularly highly skilled, workers has failed to keep up with a persistent rise in the demand for such skills.  Conversely, the demand for lesser-skilled workers has declined, especially in response to growing international competition.  The failure of our society to enhance the skills of a significant segment of our workforce has left a disproportionate share with lesser skills.  The effect, of course, is to widen the wage gap between the skilled and the lesser skilled.\\nIn a democratic society, such a stark bifurcation of wealth and income trends among large segments of the population can fuel resentment and political polarization.  These social developments can lead to political clashes and misguided economic policies that work to the detriment of the economy and society as a whole.  As I have noted on previous occasions, strengthening elementary and secondary schooling in the United States--especially in the core disciplines of math, science, and written and verbal communications--is one crucial element in avoiding such outcomes.  We need to reduce the relative excess of lesser-skilled workers and enhance the number of skilled workers by expediting the acquisition of skills by all students, both through formal education and on-the-job training.\\nAlthough the long-run challenges confronting the U.S. economy are significant, I fully anticipate that they will ultimately be met and resolved.  In recent decades our nation has demonstrated remarkable resilience and flexibility when tested by events, and we have every reason to be confident that it will weather future challenges as well.  For our part, the Federal Reserve will pursue its statutory objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment--the latter of which we have learned can best be achieved in the long run by maintaining price stability.  This is the surest contribution that the Federal Reserve can make in fostering the economic prosperity and well-being of our nation and its people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFebruary 2005 Monetary policy report | 2005 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: February 17, 2005, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan—Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, U.S. House of Representatives–July 20, 2005\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives \\r\\nJuly 20, 2005\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 21, 2005\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today to present the Federal Reserve\\'s Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn mid-February,\\r\\nwhen I presented our last report to the Congress, the economy, supported by\\r\\nstrong underlying fundamentals, appeared to be on a solid growth path, and\\r\\nthose circumstances prevailed through March. Accordingly, the Federal Open\\r\\nMarket Committee (FOMC) continued the process of a measured removal of monetary\\r\\naccommodation, which it had begun in June 2004, by raising the federal funds\\r\\nrate 1/4 percentage point at both the February and the March meetings.\\r\\n\\nThe\\r\\nupbeat picture became cloudier this spring, when data on economic activity\\r\\nproved to be weaker than most market participants had anticipated and inflation\\r\\nmoved up in response to the jump in world oil prices. By the time of the May\\r\\nFOMC meeting, some evidence suggested that the economy might have been entering\\r\\na soft patch reminiscent of the middle of last year, perhaps as a result of\\r\\nhigher energy costs worldwide. In particular, employment gains had slowed from\\r\\nthe strong pace of the end of 2004, consumer sentiment had weakened, and the\\r\\nmomentum in household and business spending appeared to have dissipated\\r\\nsomewhat.\\nAt the May\\r\\nmeeting, the Committee had to weigh the extent to which this weakness was\\r\\nlikely to be temporary--perhaps simply the product of the normal ebb and flow\\r\\nof a business expansion--and the extent to which it reflected some influence\\r\\nthat might prove more persistent, such as the further run-up in crude oil\\r\\nprices. While the incoming data highlighted some downside risks to the outlook\\r\\nfor economic growth, the FOMC judged the balance of information as suggesting\\r\\nthat the economy had not weakened fundamentally.\\nMoreover, core\\r\\ninflation had moved higher again through the first quarter. The rising prices\\r\\nof energy and other commodities continued to place upward pressures on costs,\\r\\nand reports of greater pricing power of firms indicated that they might be more\\r\\nable to pass those higher costs on to their customers. Given these\\r\\nconsiderations, the Committee continued the process of gradually removing\\r\\nmonetary accommodation in May.\\nThe data released\\r\\nover the past two months or so accord with the view that the earlier soft\\r\\nreadings on the economy were not presaging a more serious slowdown in the pace\\r\\nof activity. Employment has remained on an upward trend, retail spending has\\r\\nposted appreciable gains, inventory levels are modest, and business investment\\r\\nappears to have firmed. At the same time, low long-term interest rates have\\r\\ncontinued to provide a lift to housing activity. Although both overall and\\r\\ncore consumer price inflation have eased of late, the prices of oil and natural\\r\\ngas have moved up again on balance since May and are likely to place some upward\\r\\npressure on consumer prices, at least over the near term. Slack in labor and\\r\\nproduct markets has continued to decline. In light of these developments, the\\r\\nFOMC raised the federal funds rate at its June meeting to further reduce\\r\\nmonetary policy accommodation. That action brought the cumulative increase in\\r\\nthe funds rate over the past year to 2-1/4 percentage points.\\nShould the prices\\r\\nof crude oil and natural gas flatten out after their recent run-up--the\\r\\nforecast currently embedded in futures markets--the prospects for aggregate\\r\\ndemand appear favorable. Household spending--buoyed by past gains in wealth,\\r\\nongoing increases in employment and income, and relatively low interest\\r\\nrates--is likely to continue to expand. Business investment in equipment and\\r\\nsoftware seems to be on a solid upward trajectory in response to supportive\\r\\nconditions in financial markets and the ongoing need to replace or upgrade\\r\\naging high-tech and other equipment. Moreover, some recovery in nonresidential\\r\\nconstruction appears in the offing, spurred partly by lower vacancy rates and\\r\\nrising prices for commercial properties. However, given the comparatively less\\r\\nbuoyant growth of many foreign economies and the recent increase in the foreign\\r\\nexchange value of the dollar, our external sector does not yet seem poised to contribute\\r\\nsteadily to U.S. growth.\\nA flattening out\\r\\nof the prices of crude oil and natural gas, were it to materialize, would also\\r\\nlessen upward pressures on inflation. Overall inflation would probably drop\\r\\nback noticeably from the rates experienced in 2004 and early 2005, and core\\r\\ninflation could hold steady or edge lower. Prices of crude materials and\\r\\nintermediate goods have softened of late, and the slower rise in import prices\\r\\nthat should result from the recent strength in the foreign exchange value of\\r\\nthe dollar could also relieve some pressure on inflation.\\nThus, our baseline\\r\\noutlook for the U.S. economy is one of sustained economic growth and contained\\r\\ninflation pressures. In our view, realizing this outcome will require the\\r\\nFederal Reserve to continue to remove monetary accommodation. This generally\\r\\nfavorable outlook, however, is attended by some significant uncertainties that\\r\\nwarrant careful scrutiny.\\nWith regard to the\\r\\noutlook for inflation, future price performance will be influenced importantly\\r\\nby the trend in unit labor costs, or its equivalent, the ratio of hourly labor\\r\\ncompensation to output per hour. Over most of the past several years, the\\r\\nbehavior of unit labor costs has been quite subdued. But those costs have\\r\\nturned up of late, and whether the favorable trends of the past few years will\\r\\nbe maintained is unclear. Hourly labor compensation as measured from the\\r\\nnational income and product accounts increased sharply near the end of 2004. However,\\r\\nthat measure appears to have been boosted significantly by temporary factors.\\r\\nOther broad measures suggest that hourly labor compensation continues to rise\\r\\nat a moderate rate.\\nThe evolution of\\r\\nunit labor costs will also reflect the growth of output per hour. Over the\\r\\npast decade, the U.S. economy has benefited from a remarkable acceleration of\\r\\nproductivity: Strong gains in efficiency have buoyed real incomes and\\r\\nrestrained inflation. But experience suggests that such rapid advances are\\r\\nunlikely to be maintained in an economy that has reached the cutting edge of\\r\\ntechnology. Over the past two years, growth in output per hour seems to have\\r\\nmoved off the peak that it reached in 2003. However, the cause, extent, and\\r\\nduration of that slowdown are not yet clear. The traditional measure of the growth\\r\\nin output per hour, which is based on output as measured from the product side\\r\\nof the national accounts, has slowed sharply in recent quarters. But a\\r\\nconceptually equivalent measure that uses output measured from the income side\\r\\nhas slowed far less. Given the divergence between these two readings, a\\r\\nreasonably accurate determination of the extent of the recent slowing in\\r\\nproductivity growth and its parsing into cyclical and secular influences will\\r\\nrequire the accumulation of more evidence.\\nEnergy prices\\r\\nrepresent a second major uncertainty in the economic outlook. A further rise\\r\\ncould cut materially into private spending and thus damp the rate of economic\\r\\nexpansion. In recent weeks, spot prices for crude oil and natural gas have\\r\\nbeen both high and volatile. Prices for far-future delivery of oil and gas\\r\\nhave risen even more markedly than spot prices over the past year. Apparently,\\r\\nmarket participants now see little prospect of appreciable relief from elevated\\r\\nenergy prices for years to come. Global demand for energy apparently is\\r\\nexpected to remain strong, and market participants are evidencing increased\\r\\nconcerns about the potential for supply disruptions in various oil-producing\\r\\nregions.\\nTo be sure, the\\r\\ncapacity to tap and utilize the world\\'s supply of oil continues to expand.\\r\\nMajor advances in recovery rates from existing reservoirs have enhanced proved\\r\\nreserves despite ever fewer discoveries of major oil fields. But, going\\r\\nforward, because of the geographic location of proved reserves, the great\\r\\nmajority of the investment required to convert reserves into new crude oil\\r\\nproductive capacity will need to be made in countries where foreign investment\\r\\nis currently prohibited or restricted or faces considerable political risk.\\r\\nMoreover, the preponderance of oil and gas revenues of the dominant national\\r\\noil companies is perceived as necessary to meet the domestic needs of growing\\r\\npopulations. These factors have the potential to constrain the ability of\\r\\nproducers to expand capacity to keep up with the projected growth of world\\r\\ndemand, which has been propelled to an unexpected extent by burgeoning demand\\r\\nin emerging Asia. \\nMore\\r\\nfavorably, the current and prospective expansion of U.S. capability to import\\r\\nliquefied natural gas will help ease longer-term natural gas stringencies and\\r\\nperhaps bring natural gas prices in the United States down to world levels. \\nThe third major\\r\\nuncertainty in the economic outlook relates to the behavior of long-term\\r\\ninterest rates. The yield on ten-year Treasury notes, currently near 4-1/4\\r\\npercent, is about\\r\\n50 basis points below its level of late spring 2004. Moreover, even after the\\r\\nrecent widening of credit risk spreads, yields for both investment-grade and\\r\\nless-than-investment-grade corporate bonds have declined even more than those\\r\\non Treasury notes over the same period.\\nThis decline in\\r\\nlong-term rates has occurred against the backdrop of generally firm U.S.\\r\\neconomic growth, a continued boost to inflation from higher energy prices, and\\r\\nfiscal pressures associated with the fast approaching retirement of the\\r\\nbaby-boom generation.1\\r\\nThe drop in long-term rates is especially surprising given the increase in the\\r\\nfederal funds rate over the same period. Such a pattern is clearly without\\r\\nprecedent in our recent experience. \\nThe\\r\\nunusual behavior of long-term interest rates first became apparent last year.\\r\\nIn May and June of 2004, with a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal\\r\\nReserve widely expected, market participants built large short positions in\\r\\nlong-term debt instruments in anticipation of the increase in bond yields that\\r\\nhas been historically associated with an initial rise in the federal funds\\r\\nrate. Accordingly, yields on ten-year Treasury notes rose during the spring of\\r\\nlast year about 1 percentage point. But by summer, pressures emerged in the\\r\\nmarketplace that drove long-term rates back down. In March of this year,\\r\\nlong-term rates once again began to rise, but like last year, market forces\\r\\ncame into play to make those increases short lived.\\nConsiderable\\r\\ndebate remains among analysts as to the nature of those market forces.\\r\\nWhatever those forces are, they are surely global, because the decline in\\r\\nlong-term interest rates in the past year is even more pronounced in major\\r\\nforeign financial markets than in the\\r\\n  United States.\\nTwo distinct but\\r\\noverlapping developments appear to be at work: a longer-term trend decline in\\r\\nbond yields and an acceleration of that trend of late. Both developments are\\r\\nparticularly evident in the interest rate applying to the one-year period\\r\\nending ten years from today that can be inferred from the U.S. Treasury yield\\r\\ncurve. In 1994, that so-called forward rate exceeded 8 percent. By mid-2004,\\r\\nit had declined to about 6-1/2 percent--an easing of about 15 basis points per\\r\\nyear on average.2\\r\\nOver the past year, that drop steepened, and the forward rate fell 130 basis\\r\\npoints to less than 5 percent.\\nSome, but not all,\\r\\nof the decade-long trend decline in that forward yield can be ascribed to\\r\\nexpectations of lower inflation, a reduced risk premium resulting from less\\r\\ninflation volatility, and a smaller real term premium that seems due to a\\r\\nmoderation of the business cycle over the past few decades.3\\r\\nThis decline in inflation expectations and risk premiums is a signal\\r\\ndevelopment. As I noted in my testimony before this Committee in February, the\\r\\neffective productive capacity of the global economy has substantially\\r\\nincreased, in part because of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the\\r\\nintegration of China and India into the global marketplace. And this increase\\r\\nin capacity, in turn, has doubtless contributed to expectations of lower\\r\\ninflation and lower inflation-risk premiums.\\nIn addition to\\r\\nthese factors, the trend reduction worldwide in long-term yields surely reflects\\r\\nan excess of intended saving over intended investment. This configuration is\\r\\nequivalent to an excess of the supply of funds relative to the demand for\\r\\ninvestment. What is unclear is whether the excess is due to a glut of saving\\r\\nor a shortfall of investment. Because intended capital investment is to some\\r\\nextent driven by forces independent of those governing intended saving, the gap\\r\\nbetween intended saving and investment can be quite wide and variable. It is\\r\\nreal interest rates that bring actual capital investment worldwide and its\\r\\nmeans of financing, global saving, into equality. We can directly observe only\\r\\nthe actual flows, not the saving and investment tendencies. Nonetheless, as\\r\\nbest we can judge, both high levels of intended saving and low levels of\\r\\nintended investment have combined to lower real long-term interest rates over\\r\\nthe past decade. \\nSince the\\r\\nmid-1990s, a significant increase in the share of world gross domestic product\\r\\n(GDP) produced by economies with persistently above-average saving--prominently\\r\\nthe emerging economies of Asia--has put upward pressure on world saving. These\\r\\npressures have been supplemented by shifts in income toward the oil-exporting\\r\\ncountries, which more recently have built surpluses because of steep increases\\r\\nin oil prices. The changes in shares of world GDP, however, have had little\\r\\neffect on actual world capital investment as a percentage of GDP. The fact\\r\\nthat investment as a percentage of GDP apparently changed little when real\\r\\ninterest rates were falling, even adjusting for the shift in the shares of\\r\\nworld GDP, suggests that, on average, countries\\' investment propensities had\\r\\nbeen declining.4\\nSoftness in\\r\\nintended investment is also evident in corporate behavior. Although corporate\\r\\ncapital investment in the major industrial countries rose in recent years, it\\r\\napparently failed to match increases in corporate cash flow.5\\r\\nIn the United States, for example, capital expenditures were below the very\\r\\nsubstantial level of corporate cash flow in 2003, the first shortfall since the\\r\\nsevere recession of 1975. That development was likely a result of the business\\r\\ncaution that was apparent in the wake of the stock market decline and the\\r\\ncorporate scandals early this decade. (Capital investment in the United States\\r\\nhas only recently shown signs of shedding at least some of that caution.)\\r\\nJapanese investment exhibited prolonged restraint following the bursting of\\r\\ntheir speculative bubble in the early 1990s. And investment in emerging Asia\\r\\nexcluding China fell appreciably after the Asian financial crisis in the late\\r\\n1990s. Moreover, only a modest part of the large revenue surpluses of\\r\\noil-producing nations has been reinvested in physical assets. In fact, capital\\r\\ninvestment in the Middle East in 2004, at 25 percent of the region\\'s GDP, was\\r\\nthe same as in 1998. National saving, however, rose from 21 percent to 32\\r\\npercent of GDP. The unused saving of this region was invested in world\\r\\nmarkets.\\nWhether the excess\\r\\nof global intended saving over intended investment has been caused by weak\\r\\ninvestment or excessive saving--that is, by weak consumption--or, more likely,\\r\\na combination of both does not much affect the intermediate-term outlook for\\r\\nworld GDP or, for that matter, U.S. monetary policy. What have mattered in\\r\\nrecent years are the sign and the size of the gap of intentions and the\\r\\nimplications for interest rates, not whether the gap results from a saving glut\\r\\nor an investment shortfall. That said, saving and investment propensities do\\r\\nmatter over the longer run. Higher levels of investment relative to\\r\\nconsumption build up the capital stock and thus add to the productive potential\\r\\nof an economy.\\nThe economic\\r\\nforces driving the global saving-investment balance have been unfolding over\\r\\nthe course of the past decade, so the steepness of the recent decline in\\r\\nlong-term dollar yields and the associated distant forward rates suggests that\\r\\nsomething more may have been at work over the past year.6\\r\\nInflation premiums in forward rates ten years ahead have apparently continued\\r\\nto decline, but real yields have also fallen markedly over the past year. It\\r\\nis possible that the factors that have tended to depress real yields over the\\r\\npast decade have accelerated recently, though that notion seems implausible.\\nAccording to estimates\\r\\nprepared by the Federal Reserve Board staff, a significant portion of the sharp\\r\\ndecline in the ten-year forward one-year rate over the past year appears to\\r\\nhave resulted from a fall in term premiums. Such estimates are subject to\\r\\nconsiderable uncertainty. Nevertheless, they suggest that risk takers have\\r\\nbeen encouraged by a perceived increase in economic stability to reach out to\\r\\nmore distant time horizons. These actions have been accompanied by significant\\r\\ndeclines in measures of expected volatility in equity and credit markets\\r\\ninferred from prices of stock and bond options and narrow credit risk\\r\\npremiums. History cautions that long periods of relative stability often\\r\\nengender unrealistic expectations of its permanence and, at times, may lead to financial\\r\\nexcess and economic stress.\\n Such perceptions, many\\r\\nobservers believe, are contributing to the boom in home prices and creating\\r\\nsome associated risks. And, certainly, the exceptionally low interest rates on\\r\\nten-year Treasury notes, and hence on home mortgages, have been a major factor\\r\\nin the recent surge of homebuilding, home turnover, and particularly in the\\r\\nsteep climb in home prices. Whether home prices on average for the nation as a\\r\\nwhole are overvalued relative to underlying determinants is difficult to ascertain,\\r\\nbut there do appear to be, at a minimum, signs of froth in some local markets\\r\\nwhere home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels. Among other\\r\\nindicators, the significant rise in purchases of homes for investment since\\r\\n2001 seems to have charged some regional markets with speculative fervor. \\nThe apparent froth\\r\\nin housing markets appears to have interacted with evolving practices in\\r\\nmortgage markets. The increase in the prevalence of interest-only loans and\\r\\nthe introduction of more-exotic forms of adjustable-rate mortgages are\\r\\ndevelopments of particular concern. To be sure, these financing vehicles have\\r\\ntheir appropriate uses. But some households may be employing these instruments\\r\\nto purchase homes that would otherwise be unaffordable, and consequently their\\r\\nuse could be adding to pressures in the housing market. Moreover, these\\r\\ncontracts may leave some mortgagors vulnerable to adverse events. It is\\r\\nimportant that lenders fully appreciate the risk that some households may have\\r\\ntrouble meeting monthly payments as interest rates and the macroeconomic\\r\\nclimate change.\\nThe U.S. economy\\r\\nhas weathered such episodes before without experiencing significant declines in\\r\\nthe national average level of home prices. Nevertheless, we certainly cannot\\r\\nrule out declines in home prices, especially in some local markets. If\\r\\ndeclines were to occur, they likely would be accompanied by some economic\\r\\nstress, though the macroeconomic implications need not be substantial.\\r\\nNationwide banking and widespread securitization of mortgages make financial\\r\\nintermediation less likely to be impaired than it was in some previous episodes\\r\\nof regional house-price correction. Moreover, a decline in the national\\r\\nhousing price level would need to be substantial to trigger a significant rise\\r\\nin foreclosures, because the vast majority of homeowners have built up\\r\\nsubstantial equity in their homes despite large mortgage-market-financed\\r\\nwithdrawals of home equity in recent years. \\nHistorically, it\\r\\nhas been rising real long-term interest rates that have restrained the pace of\\r\\nresidential building and have suppressed existing home sales, high levels of\\r\\nwhich have been the major contributor to the home equity extraction that\\r\\narguably has financed a noticeable share of personal consumption expenditures\\r\\nand home modernization outlays.\\nThe trend of\\r\\nmortgage rates, or long-term interest rates more generally, is likely to be\\r\\ninfluenced importantly by the worldwide evolution of intended saving and\\r\\nintended investment. We at the Federal Reserve will be closely monitoring the\\r\\npath of this global development few, if any, have previously experienced. As I\\r\\nindicated earlier, the capital investment climate in the United States appears\\r\\nto be improving following significant headwinds since late 2000, as is that in Japan.\\r\\nCapital investment in Europe, however, remains tepid. A broad worldwide expansion\\r\\nof capital investment not offset by a rising worldwide propensity to save would\\r\\npresumably move real long-term interest rates higher. Moreover, with term\\r\\npremiums at historical lows, further downward pressure on long-term rates from\\r\\nthis source is unlikely. \\n* * *\\nWe collectively\\r\\nconfront many risks beyond those that I have just mentioned. As was tragically\\r\\nevidenced again by the bombings in London earlier this month, terrorism and\\r\\ngeopolitical risk have become enduring features of the global landscape.\\r\\nAnother prominent concern is the growing evidence of anti-globalization\\r\\nsentiment and protectionist initiatives, which, if implemented, would significantly\\r\\nthreaten the flexibility and resilience of many economies. This situation is\\r\\nespecially troubling for the United States, where openness and flexibility have\\r\\nallowed us to absorb a succession of large shocks in recent years with only\\r\\nminimal economic disruption. That flexibility is, in large measure, a\\r\\ntestament to the industry and resourcefulness of our workers and businesses.\\r\\nBut our success in this dimension has also been aided importantly by more than\\r\\ntwo and a half decades of bipartisan effort aimed at reducing unnecessary\\r\\nregulation and promoting the openness of our market economy. Going forward,\\r\\npolicymakers will need to be vigilant to preserve this flexibility, which has\\r\\ncontributed so constructively to our economic performance in recent years.\\nIn conclusion, Mr.\\r\\nChairman, despite the challenges that I have highlighted and the many I have\\r\\nnot, the U.S. economy has remained on a firm footing, and inflation continues\\r\\nto be well contained. Moreover, the prospects are favorable for a continuation\\r\\nof those trends. Accordingly, the Federal Open Market Committee in its June\\r\\nmeeting reaffirmed that it\\n\".\\r\\n. . believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely\\r\\nto be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic\\r\\nprospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\"\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n1.\\xa0 Under current law, those longer-run pressures on the\\r\\nfederal budget threaten to place the economy on an unsustainable path.

A notable reduction in geopolitical concerns, strengthening confidence in economic prospects, and an improvement in financial conditions boded well for spending and production over the second half of the year.  Still, convincing signs of a sustained acceleration in activity were not yet in evidence.  Since then, the picture has brightened.  The gross domestic product expanded vigorously over the second half of 2003 while productivity surged, prices remained stable, and financial conditions improved further.  Overall, the economy has made impressive gains in output and real incomes; however, progress in creating jobs has been limited.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLooking forward, the prospects are good for sustained expansion of the U.S. economy.  The household sector's financial condition is stronger, and the business sector has made substantial strides in bolstering balance sheets.  Narrowing credit risk spreads and a considerable rally in equity prices have reduced financing costs and increased household wealth, which should provide substantial support for spending by businesses and households.  With short-term real interest rates close to zero, monetary policy remains highly accommodative.  And it appears that the impetus from fiscal policy will stay expansionary, on net, through this year.  These circumstances all should spur the expansion of aggregate demand in 2004.  At the same time, increases in efficiency and a significant level of underutilized resources should help keep a lid on inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn retrospect, last year appears to have marked a transition from an extended period of subpar economic performance to one of more vigorous expansion.  Once again, household spending was the mainstay, with real personal consumption spending increasing nearly 4 percent and real outlays on residential structures rising about 10 percent.  Last year's reductions in personal income tax rates and the advance of rebates to those households that were eligible for the expanded child tax credit boosted the growth of real disposable personal income.  The very low level of interest rates also encouraged household spending through a variety of channels.  Automakers took advantage of low interest rates to offer attractive incentive deals, buoying the purchase of new vehicles.  The lowest home mortgage rates in decades were a major contributor to record sales of existing residences, engendering a large extraction of cash from home equity.  A significant part of that cash supported personal consumption expenditures and home improvement.  In addition, many households took out cash in the process of refinancing, often using the proceeds to substitute for higher-cost consumer debt.  That refinancing also permitted some households to lower the monthly carrying costs for their homes and thus freed up funds for other expenditures.  Not least, the low mortgage rates spurred sales and starts of new homes to very high levels.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThese developments were reflected in household financing patterns.  Home mortgage debt increased about 13 percent last year, while consumer credit expanded much more slowly.  Even though the ratio of overall household debt to income continued to increase, as it has for more than a half-century, the rise in home and equity prices enabled the ratio of household net worth to disposable income to recover to a little above its long-term average.  The low level of interest rates and large volume of mortgage refinancing activity helped reduce households' debt-service and financial-obligation ratios a bit.  And many measures of consumer credit quality improved over the year, with delinquency rates on consumer loans and home mortgages declining.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strengthening in capital spending over 2003 contributed importantly to the acceleration of real output.  In the first quarter of the year, business fixed investment extended the downtrend that began in early 2001.  Capital spending, however, ramped up considerably over the final three quarters of 2003, reflecting a pickup in expenditures for equipment and software.  Outlays for high-tech equipment showed particular vigor last year.  Even spending on communications equipment, which had been quite soft in the previous two years, accelerated.  A growing confidence of business executives in the durability of the expansion, strong final sales, the desire to renew capital stocks after replacements had been postponed, and favorable financial conditions all contributed to the turnaround in equipment spending.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, expenditures on nonresidential structures continued to contract on balance, albeit less rapidly than in 2001 and 2002.  High vacancy rates for office buildings and low rates of capacity utilization in manufacturing evidently limited the demand for new structures.  Inventory investment likewise failed to pick up much momentum over the year, as managers remained cautious.  Firms finished 2003 with lean inventories relative to sales, an encouraging sign for the expansion of production going forward.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo a considerable degree, the gathering strength of capital spending reflects a substantial improvement in the financial condition of businesses over the past few years.  Firms' profits rose steeply during 2003 following smaller gains in the previous two years.  The significantly stronger cash flow generated by profits and depreciation allowances was more than adequate to cover rising capital expenditures in the aggregate.  As a result, businesses had little need to borrow during 2003.  For the nonfinancial business sector as a whole, debt is estimated to have grown just 3-1/2 percent.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFirms encountered very receptive conditions in longer-term credit markets in 2003.  Interest rate spreads on both investment-grade and speculative-grade bond issues narrowed substantially over the year, as investors apparently became more confident about the economic expansion and saw less risk of adverse shocks from accounting and other corporate scandals.  Corporate treasurers took advantage of the attractive market conditions by issuing long-term debt to lengthen the maturities of corporate liabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a consequence, net short-term financing was extremely weak.  The stock of business loans extended by banks and commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms declined more than $100 billion over the year, apparently owing to slack demand for short-term credit rather than to a constriction in supply.  Interest-rate spreads on commercial paper, like those on corporate bonds, were quite narrow.  And although a Federal Reserve survey indicates that banks had continued to tighten lending conditions early in the year, by the second half, terms and standards were being eased noticeably.  Moreover, responses to that survey pointed to a lack of demand for business loans until late in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly as a result of the balance-sheet restructuring, business credit quality appears to have recuperated considerably over the past few years.  Last year, the default rate on bonds fell sharply, recovery rates on defaulted issues rose, the number of rating downgrades moderated substantially, and delinquencies on business loans continued to decline.  The improved balance sheets and strong profits of business firms, together with attractive terms for financing in open markets and from banks, suggest that financial conditions remain quite supportive of further gains in capital spending in coming quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe profitability of the business sector was again propelled by stunning increases in productivity.  The advance in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector picked up to\\r\\n5-1/4 percent in 2003 after unusually brisk gains in the previous two years.  The productivity performance of the past few years has been particularly striking in that these increases occurred in a period of relatively sluggish output growth.  The vigorous advance in efficiency represents a notable extension of the pickup that started around the mid-1990s.  Apparently, businesses are still reaping the benefits of the marked acceleration in technology.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe strong gains in productivity, however, have obviated robust increases in business payrolls.  To date, the expansion of employment has significantly lagged increases in output.  Gross separations from employment, two-fifths of which have been involuntary, are about what would be expected from past cyclical experience, given the current pace of output growth.  New hires and recalls from layoffs, however, are far below what historical experience indicates.  To a surprising degree, firms seem able to continue identifying and implementing new efficiencies in their production processes and thus have found it possible so far to meet increasing orders without stepping up hiring. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn all likelihood, employment will begin to grow more quickly before long as output continues to expand.  Productivity over the past few years has probably received a boost from the efforts of businesses to work off the stock of inefficiencies that had accumulated in the boom years.  As those opportunities to enhance efficiency become scarcer and as managers become more confident in the durability of the expansion, firms will surely once again add to their payrolls.\\r\\n\\r\\nA consequence of the rapid gains in productivity and slack in our labor and product markets has been sustained downward pressure on inflation.  As measured by the chain-weighted price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, prices rose less than 1 percent in 2003.  Given the biases in such indexes, this performance puts measured inflation in a range consistent with price stability--a statutory objective of the Federal Reserve and a key goal of all central banks because it is perceived as a prerequisite for maximum sustainable economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent performance of inflation has been especially notable in view of the substantial depreciation of the dollar in 2003.  Against a broad basket of currencies of our trading partners, the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar has declined about 13 percent from its peak in early 2002.  Ordinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in dollar prices of imported goods and services, because foreign exporters endeavor to avoid experiencing price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Reflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and services imported into the United States have begun to rise after declining on balance for several years, but the turnaround to date has been mild.  Apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to absorb some of the price decline measured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on profit margins it entails.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of exporters' losses, however, have apparently been offset by short forward positions against the dollar in foreign exchange markets.  A marked increase in foreign exchange derivative trading, especially in dollar-euro, is consistent with significant hedging of exports to the United States and to other markets that use currencies tied to the U.S. dollar.  However, most contracts are short-term because long-term hedging is expensive.  Thus, although hedging may delay the adjustment, it cannot eliminate the consequences of exchange rate change.  Accordingly, the currency depreciation that we have experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as foreign producers export less to the United States.  On the other side of the ledger, the current account should improve as U.S. firms find the export market more receptive.\\r\\n\\n\\t*   *   *\\n\\r\\nAlthough the prospects for the U.S. economy look quite favorable, we need to remind ourselves that all forecasts are projections into an uncertain future.  The fact that most professional forecasters perceive much the same benign short-term outlook that is our most likely expectation provides scant comfort.  When the future surprises, history tells us, it often surprises us all.  We must, as a consequence, remain alert to risks that could threaten the sustainability of the expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the chronic concern about a sharp spike in oil or natural gas prices, a number of risks can be identified.  Of particular importance to monetary policy makers is the possibility that our stance could become improperly calibrated to evolving economic developments.  To be sure, the Federal Open Market Committee's current judgment is that its accommodative posture is appropriate to foster sustainable expansion of economic activity.  But the evidence indicates clearly that such a policy stance will not be compatible indefinitely with price stability and sustainable growth; the real federal funds rate will eventually need to rise toward a more neutral level.  However, with inflation very low and substantial slack in the economy, the Federal Reserve can be patient in removing its current policy accommodation. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the process of assessing risk, we monitor a broad range of economic and financial indicators.  Included in this group are a number of measures of liquidity and credit creation in the economy.  By most standard measures, aggregate liquidity does not appear excessive.  The monetary aggregate M2 expanded only 5-1/4 percent during 2003, somewhat less than nominal GDP, and actually contracted during the fourth quarter.  The growth of nonfederal debt, at 7-3/4 percent, was relatively brisk in 2003.  However, a significant portion of that growth was associated with the record turnover of existing homes and the high level of cash-out refinancing, which are not expected to continue at their recent pace.  A narrower measure, that of credit held by banks, also grew only moderately in 2003.  All told, our accommodative monetary policy stance to date does not seem to have generated excessive volumes of liquidity or credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, as we evaluate the risks to the economy, we also assess developments in financial markets.  Broad measures of equity prices rose 25 percent in 2003, and technology stocks increased twice as quickly.  The rally has extended into this year.  And as I noted previously, credit spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed considerably, particularly for speculative-grade issues.  This performance of financial markets importantly reflects investors' response to robust earnings growth and the repair of business balance sheets over the past few years.  However, history shows that pricing financial assets appropriately in real time can be extremely difficult and that, even in a seemingly benign economic environment, risks remain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outlook for the federal budget deficit is another critical issue for policymakers in assessing our intermediate- and long-run growth prospects and the risks to those prospects.  As you are well aware, after a brief period of unified budget surpluses around the beginning of this decade, the federal budget has reverted to deficits.  The unified deficit swelled to $375 billion in fiscal 2003 and appears to be widening considerably further in the current fiscal year.  In part, these deficits are a result of the economic downturn and the period of slower growth that we recently experienced, as well as the earlier decline in equity prices.  The deficits also reflect fiscal actions specifically intended to provide stimulus to the economy, a significant step-up in spending for national security, and a tendency toward diminished restraint on discretionary spending.  Of course, as economic activity continues to expand, tax revenues should strengthen and the deficit will tend to narrow, all else being equal.  But even budget projections that attempt to take such business-cycle influences into account, such as those from the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, indicate that very sizable deficits are in prospect in the years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have noted before, the debate over budget priorities appears to be between those advocating additional tax cuts and those advocating increased spending.  Although some stirrings in recent weeks in the Congress and elsewhere have been directed at actions that would lower forthcoming deficits, to date no effective constituency has offered programs to balance the budget.  One critical element--present in the 1990s but now absent--is a framework of procedural rules to help fiscal policy makers make the difficult decisions that are required to forge a better fiscal balance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe imbalance in the federal budgetary situation, unless addressed soon, will pose serious longer-term fiscal difficulties.  Our demographics--especially the retirement of the baby-boom generation beginning in just a few years--mean that the ratio of workers to retirees will fall substantially.  Without corrective action, this development will put substantial pressure on our ability in coming years to provide even minimal government services while maintaining entitlement benefits at their current level, without debilitating increases in tax rates.  The longer we wait before addressing these imbalances, the more wrenching the fiscal adjustment ultimately will be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fiscal issues that we face pose long-term challenges, but federal budget deficits could cause difficulties even in the relatively near term.  Long-term interest rates reflect not only the balance between the current demand for, and current supply of, credit, they also incorporate markets' expectations of those balances in the future.  As a consequence, should investors become significantly more doubtful that the Congress will take the necessary fiscal measures, an appreciable backup in long-term interest rates is possible as prospects for outsized federal demands on national saving become more apparent.  Such a development could constrain investment and other interest-sensitive spending and thus undermine the private capital formation that is a key element in our economy's growth prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAddressing the federal budget deficit is even more important in view of the widening U.S. current account deficit.  In 2003, the current account deficit reached $550 billion--about 5 percent of nominal GDP.  The current account deficit and the federal budget deficit are related because the large federal dissaving represented by the budget deficit, together with relatively low rates of U.S. private saving, implies a need to attract saving from abroad to finance domestic private investment spending. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the U.S. current account deficit has been financed with little difficulty.   Although the foreign exchange value of the dollar has fallen over the past year, the decline generally has been gradual, and no material adverse side effects have been visible in U.S. capital markets.  While demands for dollar-denominated assets by foreign private investors are off their record pace of mid-2003, such investors evidently continue to perceive the United States as an excellent place to invest, no doubt owing, in large part, to our vibrant market system and our economy's very strong productivity performance.  Moreover, some governments have accumulated large amounts of dollar-denominated debt as a byproduct of resisting upward exchange rate adjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, given the already-substantial accumulation of dollar-denominated debt, foreign investors, both private and official, may become less willing to absorb ever-growing claims on U.S. residents.  Taking steps to increase our national saving through fiscal action to lower federal budget deficits would help diminish the risks that a further reduction in the rate of purchase of dollar assets by foreign investors could severely crimp the business investment that is crucial for our long-term growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large current account deficits and the associated substantial trade deficits pose another imperative--the need to maintain the degree of flexibility that has been so prominent a force for U.S. economic stability in recent years.  The greatest current threat to that flexibility is protectionism, a danger that has become increasingly visible on today's landscape.  Over the years, protected interests have often endeavored to stop in its tracks the process of unsettling economic change.  Pitted against the powerful forces of market competition, virtually all such efforts have failed.  The costs of any new protectionist initiatives, in the context of wide current account imbalances, could significantly erode the flexibility of the global economy.  Consequently, creeping protectionism must be thwarted and reversed. \\r\\n\\n\\t*   *   *\\n\\r\\nIn summary, in recent years the U.S. economy has demonstrated considerable resilience to adversity.  It has overcome significant shocks that, in the past, could have hobbled growth for a much longer period than they have in the current cycle.  As I have noted previously, the U.S. economy has become far more flexible over the past two decades, and associated improvements have played a key role in lessening the effects of the recent adverse developments on our economy.  Looking forward, the odds of sustained robust growth are good, although, as always, risks remain.  The Congress can help foster sustainable expansion by taking steps to reduce federal budget deficits and thus contribute to national saving and by continuing to pursue opportunities to open markets and promote trade.  For our part, the Federal Reserve intends to use its monetary tools to promote our goals of economic growth and maximum employment of our resources in an environment of effective price stability.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFebruary 2004 Monetary policy report | 2004 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: February 12, 2004, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan—Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, U.S. Senate --July 20, 2004\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate \\r\\nJuly 20, 2004\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 21, 2004\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tEconomic developments in the United States have generally been quite favorable in 2004, lending increasing support to the view that the expansion is self-sustaining.  Not only has economic activity quickened, but the expansion has become more broad-based and has produced notable gains in employment.  The evident strengthening in demand that underlies this improved performance doubtless has been a factor contributing to the rise in inflation this year.  But inflation also seems to have been boosted by transitory factors such as the surge in energy prices.  Those higher prices, by eroding households' disposable income, have accounted for at least some of the observed softness in consumer spending of late, a softness which should prove short-lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tWhen I testified before this Committee in February, many of the signs of the step-up in economic activity were already evident.  Capital spending had increased markedly in the second half of last year, no doubt spurred by significantly improving profits, a low cost of capital, and the investment tax incentives enacted in 2002 and enhanced in 2003.  The renewed strength in capital spending carried over into the first half of 2004.  Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods have been on the rise, and backlogs of unfilled orders for new equipment continue to build.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tA key element of the expansion that was still lacking in February, however, was evidence that businesses were willing to ramp up hiring to meet the stepped-up pace of sales and production.  Businesses' ability to boost output without adding appreciably to their workforces likely resulted from a backlog of unexploited capabilities for enhancing productivity with minimal capital investment, which was an apparent outgrowth of the capital goods boom of the 1990s.  Indeed, over much of the previous three years, managers had seemed to pursue every avenue to avoid new hiring despite rising business sales.  Their hesitancy to assume risks and expand employment was accentuated and extended by the corporate accounting and governance scandals that surfaced in the aftermath of the decline in stock prices and also, of course, by the environment of heightened geopolitical tensions.  Even now, following the pattern of recent quarters, corporate investment in fixed capital and inventories apparently continues to fall short of cash flow.  The protracted nature of this shortfall is unprecedented over the past three decades.  Moreover, the proportion of temporary hires relative to total employment continues to rise, underscoring that business caution remains a feature of the economic landscape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThat said, there have been much clearer indications over recent months that conditions in the labor market are improving.  Most notably, gains in private nonfarm payroll employment have averaged about 200,000 per month over the past six months, up sharply from the pace of roughly 60,000 per month registered over the fourth quarter of 2003.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThe improvement in labor market conditions will doubtless have important follow-on effects for household spending.  Expanding employment should provide a lift to personal disposable income, adding to the support stemming from cuts in personal income taxes over the past year.  In addition, the low interest rates of recent years have allowed many households to lower the burdens of their financial obligations.  Although mortgage rates are up from recent lows, they remain quite attractive from a longer-run perspective and are providing solid support to home sales.  Despite the softness of recent retail sales, the combination of higher current and anticipated future income, strengthened balance sheets, and still-low interest rates bodes well for consumer spending.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tConsumer prices excluding food and energy--so-called core prices--have been rising more rapidly this year than in 2003.  For example, the twelve-month change in the core personal consumption expenditures price index stood at 0.8 percent in December of last year and climbed to 1.6 percent by May of this year.  Core inflation, of course, has been elevated by the indirect effects of higher energy prices on business costs and by increases in non-oil import prices that reflect past dollar depreciation and the surge in global prices for primary commodities.  But the acceleration of core prices has been augmented by a marked rise in profit margins, even excluding domestic energy corporations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThis surge in profits reflects, at least in part, the recent recovery of demand after a couple of years during which weak demand led to relatively heavy price discounting by businesses.  Profits of nonfinancial corporations as a share of sector output, after falling to 7 percent in the third quarter of 2001, rebounded to 12 percent in the first quarter of 2004, a pace of advance not experienced since 1983.  Half of this rise in the profit share occurred between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, a period during which business costs were unusually subdued.  In fact, consolidated unit costs for the nonfinancial corporate business sector actually declined during this period.  The increase in output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate business sector of more than 6 percent accounted for much of the net decline in unit costs.  The remainder was due to the effects of rising output in reducing nonlabor fixed costs per unit of output.  Hence, at least from an accounting perspective, between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, all of the 1.1 percent increase in the prices of final goods and services produced in the nonfinancial corporate sector can be attributed to a rise in profit margins rather than rising cost pressures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tHowever, businesses are limited in the degree to which they can raise margins by raising prices.  An increase in margins should affect mainly the level of prices associated with any given level of unit costs but, by itself, should not prompt a sustained pickup in the rate of inflation going forward.  In a market economy, any tendency for profit margins to continue to rise is countered largely by the entry of new competitors willing to undercut prices and by increased labor costs as more firms attempt to exploit the opportunity for outsized profits by expanding employment and output.  That increase in competitive pressure, as history has amply demonstrated, with time, returns markups to more normal levels.  \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tOver the past three decades, the share of the profits of nonfinancial corporations in the total nominal income of that sector has fluctuated around a longer-run average of roughly \\r\\n10-1/2 percent.  The profit share in the first quarter of this year, at about 12 percent, was well above that level.  The gap suggested that the growth of unit profits would eventually slow relative to increases in unit costs.  This outlook had accorded with analysts' expectations for earnings growth over the next year, which are substantially below the realized growth of profits in recent quarters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tIndeed, some leveling or downward pressure on profit margins may already be in train, owing to a pickup in unit labor costs.  Although advances in productivity are continuing at a rate above the long-term average, they have slowed from the extraordinary pace of last summer and are now running below increases in hourly compensation.  The available information suggests that hourly compensation has been increasing at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 percent in the first half of the year.  To be sure, the increases in average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers have been subdued in recent months and barely budged in June.  But other compensation has accelerated this year, reflecting continued sizable increases in health insurance costs, a sharp increase in business contributions to pension funds, and an apparently more robust rate of growth of hourly earnings of supervisory workers.  The larger wage gains for supervisory workers together with anecdotal reports of growing skill shortages are consistent with earlier evidence of rising wage premiums for skilled workers relative to less-skilled workers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor the moment, the modest upward path of unit labor costs does not appear to threaten longer-term price stability, especially if current exceptionally high profit margins begin to come under more intense competitive pressures at home and from abroad.  Although some signs of protectionist sentiment have emerged, there is little evidence that the price-containing forces of ever-widening global competition have ebbed.  In addition, the economy is not yet operating at its productive capacity, which should help to contain cost pressures.  But we cannot be certain that this benign environment will persist and that there are not more deep-seated forces emerging as a consequence of prolonged monetary accommodation.  Accordingly, in assessing the appropriateness of the stance of policy, the Federal Reserve will pay close attention to incoming data, especially on costs and prices.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tWhat does seem clear is that the concerns about the remote possibility of deflation that had been critical in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last year can now be safely set aside.  Those deflationary pressures were largely a consequence of the stock market slump, the capital goods contraction that commenced in 2000, and, as I noted earlier, the extreme business caution that followed from these events as well as from terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and the lead-up to the war in Iraq.  Both equity prices and capital goods spending have turned up over the past year, and the probability that economic activity might stagnate has receded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tAs always, considerable uncertainties remain about the pace of the expansion and the path of inflation.  Some of those uncertainties, especially ones associated with potential terrorism both here and abroad, are difficult to quantify.  Such possibilities have threatened the balance of world supply and demand in oil markets in recent months, especially as demand has risen with the pace of world economic growth.  Yet aside from energy, markets exhibit little evidence of heightened perceptions of risk.  Credit spreads remain low, and market-based indicators of inflation expectations, after rising earlier this year, have receded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith the growth of aggregate demand looking more sustainable and with employment expanding broadly, the considerable monetary accommodation put in place starting in 2001 is becoming increasingly unnecessary.  In May, the FOMC believed that policy accommodation needed to be removed and that removal could be accomplished at a pace that is likely to be measured.  At our meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 1 percent to 1-1/4 percent, and the discount rate was raised commensurately.  Policymakers reiterated that, based on our current outlook, the removal of accommodation would likely proceed at a measured pace.  But in light of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the anticipated evolution of price pressures, the FOMC emphasized that it will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tIf economic developments are such that monetary policy neutrality can be restored at a measured pace, a relatively smooth adjustment of businesses and households to a more typical level of interest rates seems likely.  Even if economic developments dictate that the stance of policy must be adjusted in a less gradual manner to ensure price stability, our economy appears to have prepared itself for a more dynamic adjustment of interest rates.  Of course, considerably more uncertainty and hence risk surrounds the behavior of the economy with a more rapid tightening of monetary policy than is the case when tightening is more measured.  In either scenario, individual instances of financial strain cannot be ruled out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThe protracted period of low interest rates has facilitated a restructuring of household and business balance sheets.  Businesses have been able to fund longer-term debt at highly favorable interest rates and, by extending the maturity of their liabilities, have rendered net earnings and capital values less exposed to destabilizing interest rate spikes.  Households have made similar adjustments.  Between mid-2002 and mid-2003, homeowners were able to refinance at lower interest rates almost half of total outstanding home mortgage debt and thereby to substantially reduce monthly debt service payments.  Households also substituted mortgage debt for more-expensive consumer credit.  Moreover, those households and businesses that held long-term investment-grade bonds in that year accumulated realized and unrealized capital gains as long-term rates declined.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThe FOMC judged this extended period of exceptionally low interest rates to have been helpful in assisting the economy in recovering from a string of adverse shocks.  But\\r\\nin the process of returning the stance of policy to a more neutral setting, at least some of the capital gains on debt instruments registered in recent years will inevitably be reversed.  \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tPrices in financial markets have already adjusted in anticipation of a significant amount of policy tightening, engendering additional alteration of balance sheets in recent months.  An unwinding of carry trades--that is, market positions premised on low short-term financing costs--seems to be under way, at least judging from a pronounced shift in the trading portfolios of primary dealers.  In addition, investors classified as non-commercial have established net short positions in ten-year Treasury note futures in recent months.  Indeed, the swing toward a net short position on ten-year Treasury note futures has been the largest since the inception of the contract in the 1980s, likely offsetting a significant portion of the interest rate exposure of previously established carry trade positions.   \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, the recent increase in market interest rates has slowed the pace of mortgage refinancing and reportedly has precipitated some winding down of leveraged positions among major mortgage market participants.  These circumstances are quite different from the situation prevailing at this time last summer.  Then, record levels of refinancing in the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003 had pushed the duration of mortgage-backed securities (a measure of the price sensitivity of fixed-income instruments to changes in interest rates) to exceptionally low levels.  As mortgage and other long-term rates rebounded last summer, a consequence of rapidly improving economic conditions and the fading of deflationary concerns, refinancing fell sharply, removing most downward pressure on duration.  Holders of mortgage-backed securities endeavoring to hedge the resulting shifts in interest rate gaps moved rapidly to shed Treasuries and receive-fixed interest-rate swaps, and these actions magnified last summer's upturn in long-term interest rates.  In the current environment, by contrast, it appears that the scope for such mortgage hedging effects to greatly amplify an increase in long-term rates is much diminished given the decline in the pace of refinancing and the associated increase in mortgage durations that have already occurred.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLastly, very large fractions of the total outstanding obligations of businesses and households are long-term, fixed-rate debt.  As a result, rising market interest rates will not have much immediate direct effect on business and household debt service burdens.  Indeed, from early 1999 through early 2000, a period when interest rates on new home mortgage originations rose more than 150 basis points, the average interest rate on the total of home mortgage debt outstanding barely moved.  Nonetheless, despite the lock-in of low interest rate costs on a substantial share of household and business liabilities, recent higher market interest rates will, in time, show through into increased charges against household and business income.  To be sure, financial intermediaries and other creditors that extended loans or purchased securities in recent years at relatively low long-term interest rates will sustain capital losses as rates rise.  In general, however, financial intermediaries are profitable and well-capitalized and appear to be well positioned to manage in a rising rate environment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn short, financial markets along with households and businesses seem to be reasonably well prepared to cope with a transition to a more neutral stance of monetary policy.  Some risks necessarily attend this transition, but they are outweighed in our judgment by those that would be associated with maintaining the existing degree of monetary policy accommodation in the current environment.  Although many factors may affect inflation in the short-run, inflation in the long-run, it is important to remind ourselves, is a monetary phenomenon.  \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tAs we attempt to assess and manage these risks, we need, as always, to be prepared for the unexpected and to respond promptly and flexibly as situations warrant.  But although our actions need to be flexible, our objectives are not.  For twenty-five years, the Federal Reserve has worked to reestablish price stability on a sustained basis.  An environment of price stability allows households and businesses to make decisions that best promote the longer-term growth of our economy and with it our nation's continuing prosperity.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 2004 Monetary policy report |  2004 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 20, 2004, 2:30 PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan -- Monetary policy report to the Congress, U.S. Senate -- February 11, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board\\'s semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate\\r\\nFebruary 11, 2003\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Financial Services,\\r\\n\\tU.S. House of Representatives, on February 12, 2003 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased this morning to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. I will begin by reviewing the state of the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy and then turn to some key issues related to the federal budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I testified before this committee last July, I noted that, while the growth of economic activity over the first half of the year had been spurred importantly by a swing from rapid inventory drawdown to modest inventory accumulation, that source of impetus would surely wind down in subsequent quarters, as it did.  We at the Federal Reserve recognized that a strengthening of final sales was an essential element of putting the expansion on a firm and sustainable track.  To support such a strengthening, monetary policy was set to continue its accommodative stance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event, final sales continued to grow only modestly, and business outlays remained soft.  Concerns about corporate governance, which intensified for a time, were compounded over the late summer and into the fall by growing geopolitical tensions.  In particular, worries about the situation in Iraq contributed to an appreciable increase in oil prices.  These uncertainties, coupled with ongoing concerns surrounding macroeconomic prospects,  heightened investors\\' perception of risk and, perhaps, their aversion to such risk.  Equity prices weakened further, the expected volatility of equity prices rose to unusually high levels, spreads on corporate debt and credit default swaps deteriorated, and liquidity in corporate debt markets declined.  The economic data and the anecdotal information suggested that firms were tightly limiting hiring and capital spending and keeping an unusually short leash on inventories.  With capital markets inhospitable and commercial banks firming terms and standards on business loans, corporations relied to an unusual extent on a drawdown of their liquid assets rather than on borrowing to fund their limited expenditures.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy early November, conditions in financial markets had firmed somewhat on reports of improved corporate profitability.  But on November 6, with economic performance remaining subpar, the Federal Open Market Committee chose to ease the stance of monetary policy, reducing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, to 1� percent.  We viewed that action as insurance against the possibility that the still widespread weakness would become entrenched.  With inflation expectations well contained, this additional monetary stimulus seemed to offer worthwhile insurance against the threat of persistent economic weakness and unwelcome substantial declines in inflation from already low levels.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the weeks that followed, financial market conditions continued to improve, but only haltingly.  The additional monetary stimulus and the absence of further revelations of major corporate wrongdoing seemed to provide some reassurance to investors.  Equity prices rose, volatility declined, risk spreads narrowed, and market liquidity increased, albeit not to levels that might be associated with robust economic conditions.  At the same time, mounting concerns about geopolitical risks and energy supplies, amplified by the turmoil in Venezuela, were mirrored by the worrisome surge in oil prices, continued skittishness in financial markets, and substantial uncertainty among businesses about the outlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly as a result, growth of economic activity slowed markedly late in the summer and in the fourth quarter, continuing the choppy pattern that prevailed over the past year.  According to the advance estimate, real GDP expanded at an annual rate of only � percent last quarter after surging 4 percent in the third quarter.  Much of that deceleration reflected a falloff in the production of motor vehicles from the near-record level that had been reached in the third quarter when low financing rates and other incentive programs sparked a jump in sales.  The slowing in aggregate output also reflected aggressive attempts by businesses more generally to ensure that inventories remained under control.  Thus far, those efforts have proven successful in that business inventories, with only a few exceptions, have stayed lean--a circumstance that should help support production this year.  Indeed, after dropping back a bit in the fall, manufacturing activity turned up in December, and reports from purchasing managers suggest that improvement has continued into this year.  Excluding both the swings in auto and truck production and the fluctuations in non-motor-vehicle inventories, economic activity has been moving up in a considerably smoother fashion than has overall real GDP:  Final sales excluding motor vehicles are estimated to have risen at a 2� percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after a similar 1� percent advance in the previous quarter and an average of 2 percent in the first half.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, apart from these quarterly fluctuations, the economy has largely extended the broad patterns of performance that were evident at the time of my July testimony.  Most notably, output has continued to expand, but only modestly.  As previously, overall growth has simultaneously been supported by relatively strong spending by households and weighed down by weak expenditures by businesses.  Importantly, the favorable underlying trends in productivity have continued; despite little change last quarter, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 3� percent over the four quarters of 2002, an impressive gain for a period of generally lackluster economic performance.  One consequence of the combination of sluggish output growth and rapid productivity gains has been that the labor market has remained quite soft.  Employment turned down in the final months of last year, and the unemployment rate moved up, but the report for January was somewhat more encouraging.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother consequence of the strong performance of productivity has been its support of household incomes despite the softness of labor markets.  Those gains in income, combined with very low interest rates and reduced taxes, have permitted relatively robust advances in residential construction and household expenditures.  Indeed, residential construction activity moved up steadily over the year.  And despite large swings in sales, underlying demand for motor vehicles appears to have been well maintained.  Other consumer outlays, financed partly by the large extraction of built-up equity in homes, have continued to trend up.  Most equity extraction--reflecting the realized capital gains on home sales--usually occurs as a consequence of house turnover.  But during the past year, an almost equal amount reflected the debt-financed cash-outs associated with an unprecedented surge in mortgage refinancings.  Such refinancing activity is bound to contract at some point, as average interest rates on outstanding home mortgages converge to interest rates on new mortgages.  However, fixed mortgage rates remain extraordinarily low, and applications for refinancing are not far off their peaks.  Simply processing the backlog of earlier applications will take some time, and this factor alone suggests that refinancing originations and cash-outs will be significant at least through the early part of this year.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo be sure, the mortgage debt of homeowners relative to their income is high by historical norms.  But as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for the mortgage debt of homeowners relative to the corresponding disposable income of that group is well below the high levels of the early 1990s.  Moreover, owing to continued large gains in residential real estate values, equity in homes has continued to rise despite sizable debt-financed extractions.  Adding in the fixed costs associated with other financial obligations, such as rental payments of tenants, consumer installment credit, and auto leases, the total servicing costs faced by households relative to their incomes are below previous peaks and do not appear to be a significant cause for concern at this time.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhile household spending has been reasonably vigorous, we have yet to see convincing signs of a rebound in business outlays.  After having fallen sharply over the preceding two years, new orders for capital equipment stabilized and, for some categories, turned up in nominal terms in 2002.  Investment in equipment and software is estimated to have risen at a 5 percent rate in real terms in the fourth quarter and a subpar 3 percent over the four quarters of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the emergence of a sustained and broad-based pickup in capital spending will almost surely require the resumption of substantial gains in corporate profits.  Profit margins apparently did improve a bit last year, aided importantly by the strong growth in labor productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the path of capital investment will depend not only on market conditions and the prospects for profits and cash flow but also on the resolution of the uncertainties surrounding the business outlook.  Indeed, the heightening of geopolitical tensions has only added to the marked uncertainties that have piled up over the past three years, creating formidable barriers to new investment and thus to a resumption of vigorous expansion of overall economic activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intensification of geopolitical risks makes discerning the economic path ahead especially difficult.  If these uncertainties diminish considerably in the near term, we should be able to tell far better whether we are dealing with a business sector and an economy poised to grow more rapidly--our more probable expectation--or one that is still laboring under persisting strains and imbalances that have been misidentified as transitory.  Certainly, financial conditions would not seem to impose a significant hurdle to a turnaround in business spending. Yields on risk-free Treasury securities have fallen, risk spreads are narrower on corporate bonds, premiums on credit default swaps have retraced most of their summer spike, and liquidity conditions have improved in capital markets.  These factors, if maintained, should eventually facilitate more-vigorous corporate outlays.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf instead, contrary to our expectations, we find that, despite the removal of the Iraq-related uncertainties, constraints to expansion remain, various initiatives for conventional monetary and fiscal stimulus will doubtless move higher on the policy agenda.  But as part of that process, the experience of recent years may be instructive.  As I have testified before this committee in the past, the most significant lesson to be learned from recent American economic history is arguably the importance of structural flexibility and the resilience to economic shocks that it imparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not claim to be able to judge the relative importance of conventional stimulus and increased economic flexibility to our ability to weather the shocks of the past few years.  But the improved flexibility of our economy, no doubt, has played a key role.  That increased flexibility has been in part the result of the ongoing success in liberalizing global trade, a quarter-century of bipartisan deregulation that has significantly reduced rigidities in our markets for energy, transportation, communication, and financial services, and, of course, the dramatic gains in information technology that have markedly enhanced the ability of businesses to address festering economic imbalances before they inflict significant damage.  This improved ability has been facilitated further by the increasing willingness of our workers to embrace innovation more generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is reasonable to surmise that, not only have such measures contributed significantly to the long-term growth potential of the economy this past decade, they also have enhanced its short-term resistance to recession.  That said, we have too little history to measure the extent to which increasing flexibility has boosted the economy\\'s potential and helped damp cyclical fluctuations in activity.\\r\\n \\r\\nEven so, the benefits appear sufficiently large that we should be placing special emphasis on searching for policies that will engender still greater economic flexibility and dismantling policies that contribute to unnecessary rigidity.  The more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct in response to inevitable, often unanticipated, disturbances, thus reducing the size and consequences of cyclical imbalances.  Enhanced flexibility has the advantage of adjustments being automatic and not having to rest on the initiatives of policymakers, which often come too late or are based on highly uncertain forecasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicies intended to improve the flexibility of the economy seem to fall outside the sphere of traditional monetary and fiscal policy.  But decisions on the structure of the tax system and spending programs surely influence flexibility and thus can have major consequences for both the cyclical performance and long-run growth potential of our economy.  Accordingly, in view of the major budget issues now confronting the Congress and their potential implications for the economy, I thought it appropriate to devote some of my remarks today to fiscal policy.  In that regard, I will not be emphasizing specific spending or revenue programs.  Rather, my focus will be on the goals and process determining the budget and on the importance, despite our increasing national security requirements, of regaining discipline in that process.  These views are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.\\r\\n\\n\\t*   *   *\\n\\r\\nOne notable feature of the budget landscape over the past half century has been the limited movement in the ratio of unified budget outlays to nominal GDP.  Over the past five years, that ratio has averaged a bit less than 19 percent, about where it was in the 1960s before it moved up during the 1970s and 1980s.  But that pattern of relative stability over the longer term has masked a pronounced rise in the share of spending committed to retirement, medical, and other entitlement programs.  Conversely, the share of spending that is subject to the annual appropriations process, and thus that comes under regular review by the Congress, has been shrinking.  Such so-called discretionary spending has fallen from two-thirds of total outlays in the 1960s to one-third last year, with defense outlays accounting for almost all of the decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increase in the share of expenditures that is more or less on automatic pilot has complicated the task of making fiscal policy by effectively necessitating an extension of the budget horizon.  The Presidents\\' budgets through the 1960s and into the 1970s mainly provided information for the upcoming fiscal year.  The legislation in 1974 that established a new budget process and created the Congressional Budget Office required that organization to provide five-year budget projections.  And by the mid-1990s, CBO\\'s projection horizon had been pushed out to ten years.  These longer time periods and the associated budget projections, even granted their imprecision, are useful steps toward allowing the Congress to balance budget priorities sensibly in the context of a cash-based accounting system.1   But more can be done to clarify those priorities and thereby enhance the discipline on the fiscal process.\\r\\n\\r\\nA general difficulty concerns the very nature of the unified budget.  As a cash accounting system, it was adopted in 1968 to provide a comprehensive measure of the funds that move in and out of federal coffers.  With a few modifications, it correctly measures the direct effect of federal transactions on national saving.  But a cash accounting system is not designed to track new commitments and their translation into future spending and borrowing.  For budgets that are largely discretionary, changes in forward commitments do not enter significantly into budget deliberations, and hence the surplus or deficit in the unified budget is a reasonably accurate indicator of the stance of fiscal policy and its effect on saving.  But as longer-term commitments have come to dominate tax and spending decisions, such cash accounting has been rendered progressively less meaningful as the principal indicator of the state of our fiscal affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accrual-based accounting system geared to the longer horizon could be constructed with a reasonable amount of additional effort.  In fact, many of the inputs on the outlay side are already available.  However, estimates of revenue accruals are not well developed.  These include deferred taxes on retirement accounts that are taxable on withdrawal, accrued taxes on unrealized capital gains, and corporate tax accruals.  An accrual system would allow us to keep better track of the government\\'s overall accrued obligations and deferred assets.  Future benefit obligations and taxes would be recognized as they are incurred rather than when they are paid out by the government.2\\n\\r\\nCurrently, accrued outlays very likely are much greater than those calculated under the cash-based approach.  Under full accrual accounting, the social security program would be showing a substantial deficit this year, rather than the surplus measured under our current cash accounting regimen.3   Indeed, under most reasonable sets of actuarial assumptions, for social security benefits alone past accruals cumulate to a liability that amounts to many trillions of dollars.  For the government as a whole, such liabilities are still growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimating the liabilities implicit in social security is relatively straightforward because that program has many of the characteristics of a private defined-benefit retirement program.  Projections of Medicare outlays, however, are far more uncertain even though the rise in the beneficiary populations is expected to be similar.  The likelihood of continued dramatic innovations in medical technology and procedures combined with largely inelastic demand and a subsidized third-party payment system engenders virtually open-ended potential federal outlays unless constrained by law.4   Liabilities for Medicare are probably about the same order of magnitude as those for social security, and as is the case for social security, the date is rapidly approaching when those liabilities will be converted into cash outlays.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccrual-based accounts would lay out more clearly the true costs and benefits of changes to various taxes and outlay programs and facilitate the development of a broad budget strategy.  In doing so, these accounts should help shift the national dialogue and consensus toward a more realistic view of the limits of our national resources as we approach the next decade and focus attention on the necessity to make difficult choices from among programs that, on a stand-alone basis, appear very attractive.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the baby boomers have not yet started to retire in force and accordingly the ratio of retirees to workers is still relatively low, we are in the midst of a demographic lull.  But short of an outsized acceleration of productivity to well beyond the average pace of the past seven years or a major expansion of immigration, the aging of the population now in train will end this state of relative budget tranquility in about a decade\\'s time.  It would be wise to address this significant pending adjustment sooner rather than later.  As the President\\'s just-released budget put it, \"The longer the delay in enacting reforms, the greater the danger, and the more drastic the remedies will have to be.\"5\\n\\r\\nAccrual-based revenue and outlay projections, tied to a credible set of economic assumptions, tax rates, and programmatic spend-out rates, can provide important evidence on the long-term sustainability of the overall budget and economic regimes under alternative scenarios.6   Of course, those projections, useful as they might prove to be, would still be subject to enormous uncertainty.  The ability of economists to assess the effects of tax and spending programs is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the forces influencing the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that much controversy over basic questions surrounds the current debate over budget policy.  Do budget deficits and debt significantly affect interest rates and, hence, economic activity?  With political constraints on the size of acceptable deficits, do tax cuts ultimately restrain spending increases, and do spending increases limit tax cuts?  To what extent do tax increases inhibit investment and economic growth or, by raising national saving, have the opposite effect?  And to what extent does government spending raise the growth of GDP, or is its effect offset by a crowding out of private spending?\\r\\n\\r\\nSubstantial efforts are being made to develop analytical tools that, one hopes, will enable us to answer such questions with greater precision than we can now.  Much progress has been made in ascertaining the effects of certain policies, but many of the more critical questions remain in dispute.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there should be little disagreement about the need to reestablish budget discipline.  The events of September 11 have placed demands on our budgetary resources that were unanticipated a few years ago.  In addition, with defense outlays having fallen in recent years to their smallest share of GDP since before World War II, the restraint on overall spending from the downtrend in military outlays has surely run its course--and likely would have done so even without the tragedy of September 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBO and the Office of Management and Budget recently released updated budget projections that are sobering.  These projections, in conjunction with the looming demographic pressures, underscore the urgency of extending the budget enforcement rules.  To be sure, in the end, it is policy, not process, that counts.  But the statutory limits on discretionary spending and the so-called PAYGO rules, which were promulgated in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and were backed by a sixty-vote point of order in the Senate, served as useful tools for controlling deficits through much of the 1990s.  These rules expired in the House last September and have been partly extended in the Senate only through mid-April.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Budget Enforcement Act was intended to address the problem of huge unified deficits and was enacted in the context of a major effort to bring the budget under control.  In 1990, the possibility that surpluses might emerge within the decade seemed remote indeed.  When they unexpectedly arrived, the problem that the budget control measures were designed to address seemed to have been solved.  Fiscal discipline became a less pressing priority and was increasingly abandoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make the budget process more effective, some have suggested amending the budget rules to increase their robustness against the designation of certain spending items as \"emergency\" and hence not subject to the caps.  Others have proposed mechanisms, such as statutory triggers and sunsets on legislation, that would allow the Congress to make mid-course corrections more easily if budget projections go off-track--as they invariably will.  These ideas are helpful and they could strengthen the basic structure established a decade ago.  But, more important, a budget framework along the lines of the one that provided significant and effective discipline in the past needs, in my judgment, to be reinstated without delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am concerned that, should the enforcement mechanisms governing the budget process not be restored, the resulting lack of clear direction and constructive goals would allow the inbuilt political bias in favor of growing budget deficits to again become entrenched.  We are all too aware that government spending programs and tax preferences can be easy to initiate or expand but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shut down once constituencies develop that have a stake in maintaining the status quo.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Congress\\'s review of the mechanisms governing the budget process, you may want to reconsider whether the statutory limit on the public debt is a useful device.  As a matter of arithmetic, the debt ceiling is either redundant or inconsistent with the paths of revenues and outlays you specify when you legislate a budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, a technical correction in the procedure used to tie indexed benefits and individual income tax brackets to changes in \"the cost of living\" as required by law is long overdue.  As you may be aware, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has recently introduced a new price index--the so-called chained CPI.  The new index is based on the same underlying data as is the official CPI, but it combines the individual prices in a way that better measures changes in the cost of living.  In particular, the chained CPI captures more fully than does the official CPI the way that consumers alter the mix of their expenditures in response to changes in relative prices.  Because it appears to offer a more accurate measure of the true cost of living--the statutory intent--the chained CPI would be a more suitable series for the indexation of federal programs.  Had such indexing been in place during the past decade, the fiscal 2002 deficit would have been $40 billion smaller, all else being equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the present time, there seems to be a large and growing constituency for holding down the deficit, but I sense less appetite to do what is required to achieve that outcome.  Reestablishing budget balance will require discipline on both revenue and spending actions, but restraint on spending may prove the more difficult.  Tax cuts are limited by the need for the federal government to fund a basic level of services--for example, national defense.  No such binding limits constrain spending.  If spending growth were to outpace nominal GDP, maintaining budget balance would necessitate progressively higher tax rates that would eventually inhibit the growth in the revenue base on which those rates are imposed.  Deficits, possibly ever widening, would be the inevitable outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaster economic growth, doubtless, would make deficits far easier to contain.  But faster economic growth alone is not likely to be the full solution to currently projected long-term deficits.  To be sure, underlying productivity has accelerated considerably in recent years.   Nevertheless, to assume that productivity can continue to accelerate to rates well above the current underlying pace would be a stretch, even for our very dynamic economy.7   So, short of a major increase in immigration, economic growth cannot be safely counted upon to eliminate deficits and the difficult choices that will be required to restore fiscal discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the same token, in setting budget priorities and policies, attention must be paid to the attendant consequences for the real economy.  Achieving budget balance, for example, through actions that hinder economic growth is scarcely a measure of success.  We need to develop policies that increase the real resources that will be available to meet our longer-run needs.  The greater the resources available--that is, the greater the output of goods and services produced by our economy--the easier will be providing real benefits to retirees in coming decades without unduly restraining the consumption of workers.\\r\\n\\n\\t*   *   *\\n\\r\\n\\tThese are challenging times for all policymakers.  Considerable uncertainties surround the economic outlook, especially in the period immediately ahead.  But the economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of a succession of substantial blows.  Critical to our nation\\'s performance over the past few years has been the flexibility exhibited by our market-driven economy and its ability to generate substantial increases in productivity.  Going forward, these same characteristics, in concert with sound economic policies, should help to foster a return to vigorous growth of the U.S. economy to the benefit of all our citizens.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n1.

Spending by households had contributed importantly \\r\\n        to the gains in economic activity. The nation's strong underlying productivity \\r\\n        performance was providing ongoing support for household income. That rise \\r\\n        in income, combined with low interest rates, reduced taxes, and the availability \\r\\n        of substantial home equity, had spurred solid gains in consumer spending \\r\\n        and a robust advance in residential construction. \\nIn contrast, although the contraction in capital spending appeared to \\r\\n        have slowed, we had yet to see any convincing signs that a sustained pickup \\r\\n        in business spending was emerging. Moreover, heightened geopolitical tensions \\r\\n        were adding to the already considerable uncertainties that had clouded \\r\\n        the business outlook over the preceding three years. The general climate \\r\\n        of caution in the business sector was manifest in a number of ways, including \\r\\n        restrained hiring, a reluctance to invest in new capacity, and aggressive \\r\\n        actions to maintain low levels of inventories. \\nIn late February and early March, the risks and uncertainties surrounding \\r\\n        the economic outlook intensified as the range of possibilities for the \\r\\n        timing, duration, and economic consequences of the pending war in Iraq \\r\\n        appeared to widen. In financial markets, a greater sense of caution among \\r\\n        investors seemed to bolster the demand for Treasury and other fixed-income \\r\\n        securities at the expense of equities; the price of crude oil moved up, \\r\\n        as did the prices of gasoline and home heating oil; and consumer confidence \\r\\n        sagged further. After picking up in January, payroll employment and manufacturing \\r\\n        production turned down again in February and March. \\nWhen the onset of the war became imminent, financial markets rallied, \\r\\n        and the price of crude oil dropped back. Market participants seemed buoyed \\r\\n        simply by the elimination of uncertainty about the timing of the start, \\r\\n        and hence the end of hostilities, although a still-significant amount \\r\\n        of unease inevitably remained about the way the war might progress and \\r\\n        how severely it might disrupt oil production and economic activity. \\nIn such an environment, we had little ability to distinguish temporary \\r\\n        changes from more persistent shifts in underlying economic trends. For \\r\\n        that reason, the Federal Open Market Committee, at its March 18 meeting, \\r\\n        refrained from making a determination about the balance of risks with \\r\\n        respect to its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic \\r\\n        growth. At the same time, we stepped up our surveillance of economic developments. \\r\\n      \\nAs part of that surveillance, we receive virtually continuous information \\r\\n        from commodity and financial markets. The price of crude oil is now well \\r\\n        below its peak of early March, as the potential for serious supply disruptions \\r\\n        in world oil markets has diminished. Broad equity indexes remain well \\r\\n        above their lows of mid-March and have been boosted most recently by incoming \\r\\n        information on first-quarter earnings that market participants appear \\r\\n        to view as generally positive. \\nIn contrast, six weeks after the beginning of the war, we have only limited \\r\\n        readings on broader economic conditions, and that information has been \\r\\n        mixed. Households appear to have become somewhat less apprehensive about \\r\\n        the economic outlook in recent weeks, though reports from businesses have \\r\\n        not exhibited a similar improvement in tone. Consistent with this, the \\r\\n        persistent high level of new claims for unemployment insurance suggests \\r\\n        that firms may still be finding it possible to meet their customers' tepid \\r\\n        increases in demand with a leaner workforce. \\nGoing forward, some further unwinding of the economic tensions that have \\r\\n        been associated with the situation in Iraq seems likely. As that occurs, \\r\\n        the fundamental trends shaping the economic outlook should emerge more \\r\\n        clearly. As I indicated when I met with you earlier this year, I continue \\r\\n        to believe the economy is positioned to expand at a noticeably better \\r\\n        pace than it has during the past year, though the timing and the extent \\r\\n        of that improvement remains uncertain. Fundamentally, the long-run growth \\r\\n        potential of the economy remains solid. And the enhanced flexibility inherent \\r\\n        in that trend imparts resilience against shocks of the kinds that we have \\r\\n        experienced in the past few years. \\nUnfortunately, the future path of the economy is likely to come into \\r\\n        sharper focus only gradually. In the interim, we need to remain mindful \\r\\n        of the possibility that lingering business caution could be an impediment \\r\\n        to improved economic performance. \\nAs you may know, the consensus of economic forecasters is that a material \\r\\n        rebound in economic activity will develop in the second half of this year, \\r\\n        and certainly a number of elements should be working in that direction. \\r\\n        The recent improvements in financial markets that I noted earlier, if \\r\\n        maintained, would seem to suggest a turnaround in capital spending. In \\r\\n        this regard, the ongoing decline in risk spreads in corporate bond markets \\r\\n        so far this year is an encouraging development. To be sure, spreads remain \\r\\n        high by historical standards, but the constraint imposed by last fall's \\r\\n        huge run-up in risk premiums now appears to have been put largely behind \\r\\n        us. \\nIn addition, businesses should see some relief from the pressure on profit \\r\\n        margins that had developed in recent months as energy prices rose sharply, \\r\\n        and improvement on this front could be a positive development for capital \\r\\n        spending. A modestly encouraging sign is provided by the backlog of orders \\r\\n        for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, which has been moving \\r\\n        up in recent months. Households, too, are likely to welcome lower energy \\r\\n        bills and a continuation of favorable conditions in mortgage and credit \\r\\n        markets. \\nAs you know, core prices by many measures have increased very slowly \\r\\n        over the last six months. With price inflation already at a low level, \\r\\n        substantial further disinflation would be an unwelcome development, especially \\r\\n        to the extent it put pressure on profit margins and impeded the revival \\r\\n        of business spending. \\nThe balance of influences on inflation and economic activity will be \\r\\n        among the subjects of discussion by the Federal Open Market Committee \\r\\n        when it meets in six days. \\n\\n2003 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: April 30, 2003, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan -- Monetary policy report to the Congress, U.S. Senate -- July 15, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board's semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\r\\nJuly 15, 2003\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 16, 2003\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. \\nWhen in late April I last reviewed the economic outlook before this Committee, full-scale military operations in Iraq had concluded, and there were signs that some of the impediments to brisker growth in economic activity in the months leading up to the conflict were beginning to lift.  Many, though by no means all, of the economic uncertainties stemming from the situation in Iraq had been resolved, and that reduction in uncertainty had left an imprint on a broad range of indicators.\\nStock prices had risen, risk spreads on corporate bonds had narrowed, oil prices had dropped sharply, and measures of consumer sentiment appeared to be on the mend.  But, as I noted in April, hard data indicating that these favorable developments were quickening the pace of spending and production were not yet in evidence, and it was likely that the extent of the underlying vigor of the economy would become apparent only gradually. \\nIn the months since, some of the residual war-related uncertainties have abated further and financial conditions have turned decidedly more accommodative, supported, in part, by the Federal Reserve's commitment to foster sustainable growth and to guard against a substantial further disinflation.  Yields across maturities and risk classes have posted marked declines, which together with improved profits boosted stock prices and household wealth.  If the past is any guide, these domestic financial developments, apart from the heavy dose of fiscal stimulus now in train, should bolster economic activity over coming quarters.\\nTo be sure, industrial production does appear to have stabilized in recent weeks after months of declines.  Consumer spending has held up reasonably well, and activity in housing markets continues strong.  But incoming data on employment and aggregate output remain mixed.  A pervasive sense of caution reflecting, in part, the aftermath of corporate governance scandals appears to have left businesses focused on strengthening their balance sheets and, to date, reluctant to ramp up significantly their hiring and spending.  Continued global uncertainties and economic weakness abroad, particularly among some of our major trading partners, also have extended the ongoing softness in the demand for U.S. goods and services. \\nWhen the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last month, with the economy not yet showing convincing signs of a sustained pickup in growth, and against the backdrop of our concerns about the implications of a possible substantial decline in inflation, we elected to ease policy another quarter-point.  The FOMC stands prepared to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for as long as needed to promote satisfactory economic performance.  In the judgment of the Committee, policy accommodation aimed at raising the growth of output, boosting the utilization of resources, and warding off unwelcome disinflation can be maintained for a considerable period without ultimately stoking inflationary pressures. \\n    *   *   *\\nThe prospects for a resumption of strong economic growth have been enhanced by steps taken in the private sector over the past couple of years to restructure and strengthen balance sheets.  These changes, assisted by improved prices in asset markets, have left households and businesses better positioned than they were earlier to boost outlays as their wariness about the economic environment abates. \\nNowhere has this process of balance sheet adjustment been more evident than in the household sector.  On the asset side of the balance sheet, the decline in longer-term interest rates and diminished perceptions of credit risk in recent months have provided a substantial lift to the market value of nearly all major categories of household assets.  Most notably, historically low mortgage interest rates have helped to propel a solid advance in the value of the owner-occupied housing stock.  And the lowered rate at which investors discount future business earnings has contributed to the substantial appreciation in broad equity price indexes this year, reversing a portion of their previous declines.\\nIn addition, reflecting growing confidence, households have been shifting the composition of their portfolios in favor of riskier assets.  In recent months, equity mutual funds attracted sizable inflows following the redemptions recorded over much of the last year.  Moreover, strong inflows to corporate bond funds, particularly those specializing in speculative-grade securities, have provided further evidence of a renewed appetite for risk-taking among retail investors. \\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, despite the significant increase in debt encouraged by higher asset values, lower interest rates have facilitated a restructuring of existing debt.  Households have taken advantage of new lows in mortgage interest rates to refinance debt on more favorable terms, to lengthen debt maturity, and, in many cases, to extract equity from their homes to pay down other higher-cost debt.  Debt service burdens, accordingly, have declined.\\nOverall, during the first half of 2003, the net worth of households is estimated to have risen 4-1/2 percent--somewhat faster than the rise in nominal disposable personal income.  Only 15 percent of that increase in wealth represented the accumulated personal saving of households. Additions to net worth have largely reflected capital gains both from financial investments and from home price appreciation.  Net additions to home equity, despite very large extractions, remained positive in the first half.\\nSignificant balance-sheet restructuring in an environment of low interest rates has gone far beyond that experienced in the past.  In large measure, this reflects changes in technology and mortgage markets that have dramatically transformed accumulated home equity from a very illiquid asset into one that is now an integral part of households' ongoing balance-sheet management and spending decisions.  This enhanced capacity doubtless added significant support to consumer markets during the past three years as numerous shocks--a stock price fall, 9/11, and the Iraq war--pummeled consumer sentiment.\\nHouseholds have been able to extract home equity by drawing on home equity loan lines, by realizing capital gains through the sale of existing homes, and by extracting cash as part of the refinancing of existing mortgages, so-called cash-outs.  Although all three of these vehicles have been employed extensively by homeowners in recent years, home turnover has accounted for most equity extraction. \\nSince originations to purchase existing homes tend to be roughly twice as large as repayments of the remaining balances on outstanding mortgages of home sellers, the very high levels of existing home turnover have resulted in substantial equity extraction, largely realized capital gains.  Indeed, of the estimated net increase of $1.1 trillion in home mortgage debt during the past year and a half, approximately half resulted from existing home turnover. \\nThe huge wave of refinancings this year and last has been impressive.  Owing chiefly to the decline in mortgage rates to their lowest levels in more than three decades, estimated mortgage refinancings net of cash-outs last year rose to a record high of more than $1.6 trillion.  With mortgage rates declining further in recent months, the pace of refinancing surged even higher over the first half of this year.  Cash-outs also increased, but at a slowed pace.  Net of duplicate refinancings, approximately half of the dollar value of outstanding regular mortgages has been refinanced during the past year and a half.  Moreover, applications to refinance existing mortgages jumped to record levels last month.  Given that refinance applications lead originations by about five weeks and that current mortgage rates remain significantly below those on existing mortgages, refinance originations likely will remain at an elevated level well into the current quarter.  \\nWe expect both equity extraction and lower debt service to continue to provide support for household spending in the period ahead, though the strength of this support is likely to diminish over time.  In recent quarters, low mortgage rates have carried new home sales and construction to elevated levels.  Sales of new single-family homes through the first five months of this year are well ahead of last year's record pace.  And declines in financing rates on new auto loans to the lowest levels in many years have spurred purchases of new motor vehicles.\\n    *   *   *\\nIn addition to balance sheet improvements, the recently passed tax legislation will provide a considerable lift to disposable incomes of households in the second half of the year, even after accounting for some state and local offsets.  At this point, most firms have likely implemented the lower withholding schedules that have been released by the Treasury, and advance rebates of child tax credits are being mailed beginning later this month.  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that these and other tax changes should increase households' cash flow in the third quarter by $35 billion.  Most mainstream economic models predict that such tax-induced increases in disposable income should produce a prompt and appreciable pickup in consumer spending.  Moreover, most models would also project positive follow-on effects on capital spending.  The evolution of spending over the next few months may provide an important test of the extent to which this traditional view of expansionary fiscal policy holds in the current environment.\\n    *   *   *\\nMuch like households, businesses have taken advantage of low interest rates to shore up their balance sheets.  Most notably, firms have issued long-term debt and employed the proceeds to pay down commercial paper, bank loans, and other short-term debt.  Although rates on commercial paper and bank loans are well below yields on new long-term bonds, firms have evidently judged that now is an opportune time to lock in long-term funding and avoid the liquidity risks that can be associated with heavy reliance on short-term funding.  At the same time, the average coupon on outstanding corporate bonds remains considerably above rates on new debt issues, suggesting that firms are well positioned to cut their debt service burdens still further as outstanding bonds mature or are called.  The net effect of these trends to date has been a decline in the ratio of business interest payments to net cash flow, a significant increase in the average maturity of liabilities, and a rise in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities.\\nWith business balance sheets having been strengthened and with investors notably more receptive to risk, the overall climate in credit markets has become more hospitable in recent months.  Specifically, improvements in forward-looking measures of default risk, a decline in actual defaults, and a moderation in the pace of debt-rating downgrades have prompted a marked narrowing of credit spreads and credit default swap premiums.  That change in sentiment has extended even to the speculative-grade bond market, where issuance has revived considerably, even by lower-tier issuers that would have been hard-pressed to tap the capital markets over much of the last few years.  Banks, for their part, remain well-capitalized and willing lenders. \\nIn the past, such reductions in private yields and in the cost of capital faced by firms have been associated with rising capital spending.  But as yet there is little evidence that the more accommodative financial environment has materially improved the willingness of top executives to increase capital investment.  Corporate executives and boards of directors are seemingly unclear, in the wake of the recent intense focus on corporate behavior, about how an increase in risk-taking on their part would be viewed by shareholders and regulators. \\nAs a result, business leaders have been quite circumspect about embarking on major new investment projects.  Moreover, still-ample capacity in some sectors and lingering uncertainty about the strength of prospective final sales have added to the reluctance to expand capital outlays.  But should firms begin to perceive that the pickup in demand is durable, they doubtless would be more inclined to increase hiring and production, replenish depleted inventories, and bring new capital on line.  These actions in turn would tend to further boost incomes and output.  \\nTentative signs suggest that this favorable dynamic may be beginning to take hold.  Industrial production, as I indicated earlier, seems to have stabilized, and various regional and national business surveys point to a recent firming in new orders.  Indeed, the backlog of unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, increased, on net, over the first five months of this year.  Investment in structures, however, continues to weaken.\\nThe outlook for business profits is, of course, a key factor that will help determine whether the stirrings we currently observe in new orders presage a sustained pickup in production and new capital spending.  Investors' outlook for near-term earnings has seemed a little brighter of late. \\nThe favorable productivity trend of recent years, if continued, would certainly bode well for future profitability.  Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2-1/2 percent over the year ending in the first quarter.  It has been unusual that firms have been able to achieve consistently strong gains in productivity when the overall performance of the economy has been so lackluster.  To some extent, companies under pressure to cut costs in an environment of \\r\\nstill-tepid sales growth and an uncertain economic outlook might be expected to search aggressively for ways to employ resources more efficiently.  That they have succeeded, in general, over a number of quarters suggests that a prior accumulation of inefficiencies was available to be eliminated.  One potential source is that from 1995 to 2000 heavy emphasis on new and expanding markets likely diverted corporate management from tight cost controls whose payoffs doubtless seemed small relative to big-picture expansion.  \\nHowever, one consequence of these improvements in efficiency has been an ability of many businesses to pare existing workforces and still meet increases in demand.  Indeed, with the growth of real output below that of labor productivity for much of the period since 2000, aggregate hours and employment have fallen, and the unemployment rate rose last month to 6.4 percent of the civilian labor force.\\n    *   *   *\\nAlthough forward-looking indicators are mostly positive, downside risks to the business outlook are also apparent, including the partial rebound in energy costs and some recent signs that aggregate demand may be flagging among some of our important trading partners.  Oil prices, after dropping sharply in March on news that the Iraqi oil fields had been secured, have climbed back above $30 per barrel as market expectations for a quick return of Iraqi production appear to have been overly optimistic given the current security situation. \\nAlso worrisome is the rise in natural gas prices.  Natural gas accounts for a substantial portion of total unit energy costs of production among nonfinancial, non-energy-producing firms. And as I noted in testimony last week, futures markets anticipate that the current shortage in natural gas will persist well into the future.  Although they project a near-term modest decline from highly elevated levels, contracts written for delivery in 2009 in excess of $4.50 per million Btu are still at double the levels that had been contemplated when much of our existing gas-using capital stock was put in place. \\nThe timing and extent of the pickup in economic activity in the United States will also depend on global developments.  Lethargic growth among many of our important global trading partners is posing some downside risk to the U.S. economic outlook.  As has been true for some time, Japan's economy remains in difficult straits, burdened by a weak banking sector and an ongoing deflation, although recent data have seemed somewhat less negative.  Economic activity in many European countries--especially Germany--has been soft of late and has been accompanied by a decline in inflation to quite low levels.  While Japan and Europe should benefit from global economic recovery, the near-term weakness remains a concern.\\n    *   *   *\\nInflation developments have been important in shaping the economic outlook and the stance of policy over the first half of the year.  With the economy operating below its potential for much of the past two years and productivity growth proceeding apace, measures of core consumer prices have decelerated noticeably.  Allowing for known measurement biases, these inflation indexes have been in a neighborhood that corresponds to effective price stability--a long-held goal assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.  But we can pause at this achievement only for a moment, mindful that we face new challenges in maintaining price stability, specifically to prevent inflation from falling too low.  \\nThis is one reason the FOMC has adopted a quite accommodative stance of policy.  A very low inflation rate increases the risk that an adverse shock to the economy would be more difficult to counter effectively.  Indeed, there is an especially pernicious, albeit remote, scenario in which inflation turns negative against a backdrop of weak aggregate demand, engendering a corrosive deflationary spiral.\\nUntil recently, this topic was often regarded as an academic curiosity.  Indeed, a decade ago, most economists would have dismissed the possibility that a government issuing a fiat currency would ever produce too little inflation.  However, the recent record in Japan has reopened serious discussion of this issue.  To be sure, there are credible arguments that the Japanese experience is idiosyncratic.  But there are important lessons to be learned, and it is incumbent on a central bank to anticipate any contingency, however remote, if significant economic costs could be associated with that contingency. \\nThe Federal Reserve has been studying how to provide policy stimulus should our primary tool of adjusting the target federal funds rate no longer be available.  Indeed, the FOMC devoted considerable attention to this subject at its June meeting, examining potentially feasible policy alternatives.  However, given the now highly stimulative stance of monetary and fiscal policy and well-anchored inflation expectations, the Committee concluded that economic fundamentals are such that situations requiring special policy actions are most unlikely to arise.  Furthermore, with the target funds rate at 1 percent, substantial further conventional easings could be implemented if the FOMC judged such policy actions warranted.  Doubtless, some financial firms would experience difficulties in such an environment, but these intermediaries have exhibited considerable flexibility in the past to changing circumstances.  More broadly, as I indicated earlier, the FOMC stands ready to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for as long as it takes to achieve a return to satisfactory economic performance.\\n\\nJuly 2003 Monetary policy report | 2003 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\nLast update: July 15, 2003, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan -- Monetary policy report to the Congress, U.S. House -- February 27, 2002\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board's semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives \\r\\nFebruary 27, 2002\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince July, when I last reported to you on the\\r\\nconduct of monetary policy, the U.S. economy has\\r\\ngone through a period of considerable strain, with\\r\\noutput contracting for a time and unemployment rising. \\r\\nWe in the Federal Reserve System acted vigorously to\\r\\nadjust monetary policy in an endeavor both to limit the\\r\\nextent of the downturn and to hasten its completion. \\r\\nDespite the disruptions engendered by the terrorist\\r\\nattacks of September 11, the typical dynamics of the\\r\\nbusiness cycle have re-emerged and are prompting a\\r\\nfirming in economic activity. An array of influences\\r\\nunique to this business cycle, however, seems likely to\\r\\nmoderate the speed of the anticipated recovery.\\nAt the time of our last report, the economy was\\r\\nweakening. Many firms were responding to the\\r\\nrealization that significant overcapacity had developed. \\r\\nThe demand for capital goods had dropped sharply,\\r\\nand inventories were uncomfortably high in many\\r\\nindustries. In response, businesses slashed production,\\r\\nand the resulting declines in incomes amplified the\\r\\ncyclical downturn. Real gross domestic product did\\r\\nnot grow in the second quarter and contracted in the\\r\\nthird.\\n\\n\\nA coincident deceleration in activity among the\\r\\nworld economies was evident over the past year,\\r\\nowing, at least in part, to the retrenchment in the\\r\\nhigh-technology sector and the global reach of the\\r\\ncapital markets in which the firms in that sector are\\r\\nvalued and funded. However, before the terrorist\\r\\nattacks, it was far from obvious that this concurrent\\r\\nweakness was becoming self-reinforcing. Indeed,\\r\\nimmediately prior to September 11, some sectors\\r\\nexhibited tentative signs of stabilization, contributing to\\r\\na hope that the worst of the previous cumulative\\r\\nweakness in world economic activity was nearing an\\r\\nend.\\nThat hope was decisively dashed by the tragic\\r\\nevents of early September. Adding to the intense\\r\\nforces weighing on asset prices and economic activity\\r\\nbefore September 11 were new sources of uncertainty\\r\\nthat began to press down on global demand for goods\\r\\nand services. Economies almost everywhere\\r\\nweakened further, a cause for increasing uneasiness. \\r\\nThe simultaneous further slowing in activity raised\\r\\nconcerns that a self-reinforcing cycle of contraction, fed\\r\\nby perceptions of greater economic risk, could\\r\\ndevelop. Such an event, though rare, would not be\\r\\nunprecedented in business-cycle history.\\n\\n\\nIf ever a situation existed in which the fabric of\\r\\nbusiness and consumer confidence, both here and\\r\\nabroad, was vulnerable to being torn, the shock of\\r\\nSeptember 11 was surely it. In addition to the horrific\\r\\nloss of life, enormous uncertainties accompanied the\\r\\nunfolding events and their implications for the economy. \\r\\nIndeed, for a period of weeks, U.S. economic activity\\r\\ndid drop dramatically in response to that shock.\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the strikes, the\\r\\nFederal Reserve engaged in aggressive action to\\r\\ncounter the effects of the shock on payment systems\\r\\nand financial markets. We provided a huge volume of\\r\\nreserves through open market operations, the discount\\r\\nwindow, and other means to facilitate the functioning of\\r\\nthe financial system. We worked closely with many\\r\\nmarket participants, industry groups, and other\\r\\ngovernment officials on a broad range of financial\\r\\ninfrastructure problems that needed to be resolved\\r\\nquickly and in the common interest.\\nStill, market functioning was impaired for a\\r\\ntime. The substantial damage to trading, settlement,\\r\\nand communications facilities forced many market\\r\\nparticipants to their backup sites. Owing in part to\\r\\ncareful and thorough contingency planning, many firms,\\r\\nmarkets, and exchanges were able to resume business\\r\\nwithin a few hours or days of the attacks. Nonetheless,\\r\\nthe episode did reveal threats to, and vulnerabilities of,\\r\\nthe operations of financial institutions that had not been\\r\\npreviously considered and illustrated the significant\\r\\ninterdependence of the modern financial infrastructure. \\r\\nInstitutions will need to continue to work diligently\\r\\ntoward ensuring that their backup capabilities are\\r\\nadequate. We at the Federal Reserve have been\\r\\nreexamining intensively our own contingency\\r\\ncapabilities to ensure that our central banking functions\\r\\ncan be performed in the most pressing of emergency\\r\\ncircumstances.\\nIn the weeks following the attacks, along with\\r\\nthe drops in activity and confidence, equity prices fell\\r\\nmarkedly, and lenders became more cautious, boosting\\r\\nrisk premiums, especially on credits already considered\\r\\nto be weak. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced\\r\\nshort-term interest rates considerably further. \\r\\nLonger-term yields, including mortgage rates, fell to\\r\\nextraordinarily low levels. The monetary stimulus that\\r\\nwe provided was visible not only in interest rates but\\r\\nalso in a rapid growth of liquidity over the final months\\r\\nof the year, as gauged by the broad monetary\\r\\naggregates. As the fourth quarter progressed, business\\r\\nand consumer confidence recovered, no doubt buoyed\\r\\nby successes in the war on terrorism. The improved\\r\\nsentiment seemed to buffer the decline in economic\\r\\nactivity.\\nIndeed, in the past several months, increasing\\r\\nsigns have emerged that some of the forces that have\\r\\nbeen restraining the economy over the past year are\\r\\nstarting to diminish and that activity is beginning to firm. \\r\\nThe appearance of these signs, in circumstances in\\r\\nwhich the level of the real federal funds rate was at a\\r\\nvery low level, led the Federal Open Market\\r\\nCommittee to keep policy unchanged at its meeting in\\r\\nlate January, although it retained its assessment that the\\r\\nrisks were tilted toward economic weakness.\\n\\n\\nOne key consideration in the assessment that\\r\\nthe economy is close to a turning point is the behavior\\r\\nof inventories. Stocks in many industries have been\\r\\ndrawn down to levels at which firms will soon need to\\r\\ntaper off their rate of liquidation, if they have not\\r\\nalready done so. Any slowing in the rate of inventory\\r\\nliquidation will induce a rise in industrial production if\\r\\ndemand for those products is stable or is falling only\\r\\nmoderately. That rise in production will, other things\\r\\nbeing equal, increase household income and spending. \\r\\nThe runoff of inventories, even apart from the large\\r\\nreduction in motor vehicle stocks, remained sizable in\\r\\nthe fourth quarter. Hence, with production running well\\r\\nbelow sales, the lift to income and spending from the\\r\\ninevitable cessation of inventory liquidation could be\\r\\nsignificant.\\nBut that impetus to the growth of activity will be\\r\\nshort-lived unless sustained increases in final demand\\r\\nkick in before the positive effects of the swing from\\r\\ninventory liquidation dissipate. Most recoveries in the\\r\\npost-World War II period received a boost from a\\r\\nrebound in demand for consumer durables and housing\\r\\nfrom recession-depressed levels in addition to an\\r\\nabatement of inventory liquidation. Through much of\\r\\nlast year's slowdown, however, spending by the\\r\\nhousehold sector held up well and proved to be a\\r\\nmajor stabilizing force. As a consequence, although\\r\\nhousehold spending should continue to trend up, the\\r\\npotential for significant acceleration in activity in this\\r\\nsector is likely to be more limited than in past cycles.\\nIn fact, there are a number of cross currents in\\r\\nthe outlook for household spending. In recent months,\\r\\nlow mortgage interest rates and favorable weather have\\r\\nprovided considerable support to homebuilding. \\r\\nMoreover, attractive mortgage rates have bolstered the\\r\\nsales of existing homes and the extraction of capital\\r\\ngains embedded in home equity that those sales\\r\\nengender. Low rates have also encouraged households\\r\\nto take on larger mortgages when refinancing their\\r\\nhomes. Drawing on home equity in this manner is a\\r\\nsignificant source of funding for consumption and home\\r\\nmodernization. The pace of such extractions likely\\r\\ndropped along with the decline in refinancing activity\\r\\nthat followed the backup in mortgage rates that began\\r\\nin early November. But mortgage rates remain at low\\r\\nlevels and should continue to underpin activity in this\\r\\nsector.\\nConsumer spending received a considerable lift\\r\\nfrom the sales of new motor vehicles, which were\\r\\nremarkably strong in October and November owing to\\r\\nmajor financing incentives. Sales have receded\\r\\nsomewhat as incentives were scaled back, but they\\r\\nhave remained surprisingly resilient. Other consumer\\r\\nspending appears to have advanced at a solid pace in\\r\\nrecent months.\\nThe substantial declines in the prices of natural\\r\\ngas, fuel oil, and gasoline have clearly provided some\\r\\nsupport to real disposable income and spending. To\\r\\nhave a more persistent effect on the ongoing growth of\\r\\ntotal personal consumption expenditures, energy prices\\r\\nwould need to continue declining. Futures prices do\\r\\nnot suggest that such an outcome is in the offing, though\\r\\nthe forecast record of these markets is less than\\r\\nimpressive.\\nChanges in household financial positions in\\r\\nrecent years are probably damping consumer spending,\\r\\nat least to a degree. Overall household wealth relative\\r\\nto income has dropped from a peak multiple of about\\r\\n6.3 at the end of 1999 to around 5.3 currently. \\r\\nMoreover, the aggregate household debt service\\r\\nburden, defined as the ratio of households' required\\r\\ndebt payments to their disposable personal income,\\r\\nrose considerably in recent years, returning last year to\\r\\nits previous cyclical peak of the mid-1980s.\\r\\n\\n\\nHowever, neither wealth nor the burden of debt\\r\\nis distributed evenly across households. Hence, the\\r\\nspending effects of changes in these influences also will\\r\\nnot be evenly distributed. For example, increased debt\\r\\nburdens appear disproportionately attributable to\\r\\nhigher-income households. Calculations by staff at the\\r\\nFederal Reserve suggest that the ratio of household\\r\\nliabilities to annual income for the top fifth of all\\r\\nhouseholds ranked by income, who accounted for 44\\r\\npercent of total after-tax household income last year,\\r\\nrose from about 1.10 at the end of 1998 to 1.20 at the\\r\\nend of the third quarter of 2001. The increase for the\\r\\nlower four-fifths was only about half as large. Although\\r\\nhigh-income households should not experience much\\r\\nstrain in meeting their obligations, others might. Indeed,\\r\\nrepayment difficulties have already increased,\\r\\nparticularly in the subprime markets for consumer loans\\r\\nand mortgages. Delinquency rates may well worsen as\\r\\na delayed result of the strains on household finances\\r\\nover the past two years. Large erosions, however, do\\r\\nnot seem likely, and the overall levels of debt and\\r\\nrepayment delinquencies do not, as of now, appear to\\r\\npose a major impediment to a moderate expansion of\\r\\nconsumption spending going forward. \\nAlthough the macroeconomic effects of debt\\r\\nburdens may be limited, we have already seen\\r\\nsignificant spending restraint among the top fifth of\\r\\nincome earners, presumably owing to the drop in equity\\r\\nprices. The effect of the stock market on other\\r\\nhouseholds' spending has been less evident. \\r\\nModerate-income households have a much larger\\r\\nproportion of their assets in homes, and the continuing\\r\\nrise in the value of houses has provided greater support\\r\\nfor their net worth. Reflecting these differences in\\r\\nportfolio composition, the net worth of the top fifth of\\r\\nincome earners has dropped far more than it did for the\\r\\nbottom 80 percent.\\nAs a consequence, excluding capital gains and\\r\\nlosses from the calculation, as is the convention in our\\r\\nnational income accounts, personal saving for the upper\\r\\nfifth, which had been negative during 1999 and 2000,\\r\\nturned positive in 2001. By contrast, the average\\r\\nsaving rate for the lower four-fifths of households, by\\r\\nincome, was generally positive during the second half of\\r\\nthe 1990s and has fluctuated in a narrow range in the\\r\\npast two years. Accordingly, most of the change in\\r\\nconsumption expenditures that resulted from the bull\\r\\nstock market, and its demise, reflected shifts in\\r\\nspending by upper-income households. The restraining\\r\\neffects from the net decline in wealth during the past\\r\\ntwo years presumably have not, as yet, fully played out\\r\\nand could exert some further damping effect on the\\r\\noverall growth of household spending relative to that of\\r\\nincome.  \\r\\n     \\r\\nPerhaps most central to the outlook for\\r\\nconsumer spending will be developments in the labor\\r\\nmarket. The pace of layoffs quickened last fall,\\r\\nespecially after September 11, and the unemployment\\r\\nrate rose sharply. However, layoffs diminished\\r\\nnoticeably in January, and the reported unemployment\\r\\nrate declined though adjusting for seasonal influences\\r\\nwas difficult last month. Moreover, initial claims for\\r\\nunemployment insurance have decreased markedly, on\\r\\nbalance, providing further evidence of an improvement\\r\\nin labor market conditions. Even if the economy is on\\r\\nthe road to recovery, the unemployment rate, in typical\\r\\ncyclical fashion, may resume its increase for a time, and\\r\\na soft labor market could put something of a damper on\\r\\nconsumer spending.\\nHowever, the extent of such restraint will\\r\\ndepend on how much of any rise in unemployment is\\r\\nthe result of weakened demand for goods and services\\r\\nand how much reflects strengthened productivity. In\\r\\nthe latter case, average real incomes of workers could\\r\\nrise, at least partially offsetting losses of purchasing\\r\\npower that stem from diminished levels of employment. \\r\\nIndeed, preliminary data suggest that productivity has\\r\\nheld up very well of late, and history suggests that any\\r\\ndepressing effect of rapid productivity growth on\\r\\nemployment is only temporary.\\n\\n\\nThe dynamics of inventory investment and the\\r\\nbalance of factors influencing consumer demand will\\r\\nhave important consequences for the economic outlook\\r\\nin coming months. But the broad contours of the\\r\\npresent cycle have been, and will continue to be, driven\\r\\nby the evolution of corporate profits and capital\\r\\ninvestment.\\r\\n     \\r\\nThe retrenchment in capital spending over the\\r\\npast year and a half was central to the sharp slowing\\r\\nwe experienced in overall activity. The steep rise in\\r\\nhigh-tech spending that occurred in the early post-Y2K\\r\\nmonths was clearly not sustainable. The demand for\\r\\nmany of the newer technologies was growing rapidly,\\r\\nbut capacity was expanding even faster, and that\\r\\nimbalance exerted significant downward pressure on\\r\\nprices and the profits of producers of high-tech goods\\r\\nand services. New orders for equipment and software\\r\\nhesitated in the middle of 2000 and then fell abruptly as\\r\\nfirms re-evaluated their capital investment programs. \\r\\nUncertainty about economic prospects boosted risk\\r\\npremiums significantly, and this rise, in turn, propelled\\r\\nrequired, or hurdle, rates of return to markedly elevated\\r\\nlevels. In most cases, businesses required that new\\r\\ninvestments pay off much more rapidly than they had\\r\\npreviously. For much of last year, the resulting decline\\r\\nin investment outlays was fierce and unrelenting. \\r\\nAlthough the weakness was most pronounced in the\\r\\ntechnology area, reductions in capital outlays were\\r\\nbroad-based.\\nThese cutbacks in capital spending interacted\\r\\nwith, and were reinforced by, falling profits and equity\\r\\nprices. Indeed, a striking feature of the current cyclical\\r\\nepisode relative to many earlier ones has been the\\r\\nvirtual absence of pricing power across much of\\r\\nAmerican business, as increasing globalization and\\r\\nderegulation have enhanced competition. In this\\r\\nlow-inflation environment, firms have perceived very\\r\\nlittle ability to pass cost increases on to customers. To\\r\\nbe sure, growth in hourly labor compensation has\\r\\nmoderated in response to slowed inflation and\\r\\ndeteriorating economic conditions. A significant falloff\\r\\nin stock-option realizations and in other forms of\\r\\ncompensation related to company performance has\\r\\nlikely been a factor. But over most of the past year,\\r\\neven those smaller hourly compensation increases\\r\\noutstripped gains in output per hour, on balance,\\r\\nprecipitating a marked decline in profit margins.  \\nBusiness managers, with little opportunity to\\r\\nraise prices, have moved aggressively to stabilize cash\\r\\nflows by trimming workforces. These efforts have\\r\\nlimited any rise in unit costs, attenuated the pressure on\\r\\nprofit margins, and ultimately helped to preserve the\\r\\nvast majority of private-sector jobs. To the extent that\\r\\nbusinesses are successful in stabilizing and eventually\\r\\nboosting profits and cash flow, capital spending should\\r\\nbegin to recover more noticeably.\\nPart of the reduction in pricing power observed\\r\\nin this cycle should be reversed as firming demand\\r\\nenables firms to take back large price discounts. \\r\\nThough such an adjustment would tend to elevate price\\r\\nlevels, underlying inflationary cost pressures should\\r\\nremain contained. To be sure, output per hour is not\\r\\nlikely to accelerate this year as much as in a typical\\r\\nrecovery because businesses have not delayed, as they\\r\\nhave in past recessions, shedding workers at the first\\r\\nindications of weakened demand. But slack in labor\\r\\nmarkets and further increases in productivity should\\r\\nhold labor costs in check and result in rising profit\\r\\nmargins even with inflation remaining low. \\nImproved profit margins and more assured\\r\\nprospects for rising final demand would likely be\\r\\naccompanied by a decline in risk premiums from their\\r\\ncurrent elevated levels toward a more normal range. \\r\\nWith real rates of return on high-tech equipment still\\r\\nattractive, that should provide an additional spur to new\\r\\ninvestment. Reports from businesses around the\\r\\ncountry suggest that the exploitation of available\\r\\nnetworking and other information technologies was only\\r\\npartially completed when the cyclical retrenchment of\\r\\nthe past year began. Many business managers are still\\r\\nof the view, according to a recent survey of purchasing\\r\\nmanagers, that less than half of currently available new,\\r\\nand presumably profitable, supply-chain technologies\\r\\nhave been put into use.\\nRecent evidence suggests that a recovery in at\\r\\nleast some forms of high-tech investment could already\\r\\nbe under way. Production of semiconductors, which in\\r\\nthe past has been a leading indicator of computer\\r\\nproduction, turned up last fall. Expenditures on\\r\\ncomputers rose at a double-digit annual rate in real\\r\\nterms last quarter. But the contraction of investment\\r\\nexpenditures in the communications sector, where the\\r\\namount of overcapacity was substantial, as yet shows\\r\\nfew signs of abating, and business investment in some\\r\\nother sectors, such as aircraft, hit by the drop in air\\r\\ntravel, will presumably remain weak this year.\\nOn balance, the recovery in overall spending on\\r\\nbusiness fixed investment is likely to be only gradual; in\\r\\nparticular, its growth will doubtless be less frenetic than\\r\\nin 1999 and early 2000--a period during which outlays\\r\\nwere boosted by the dislocations of Y2K and the\\r\\nextraordinarily low cost of equity capital available to\\r\\nmany firms. Nonetheless, if the recent more-favorable\\r\\neconomic developments gather momentum,\\r\\nuncertainties will diminish, risk premiums will fall, and\\r\\nthe pace of capital investment embodying new\\r\\ntechnologies will increase.\\nEven a subdued recovery beginning soon would\\r\\nconstitute a truly remarkable performance for the\\r\\nAmerican economy in the face of so severe a decline in\\r\\nequity asset values and an unprecedented blow from\\r\\nterrorists to the foundations of our market systems. \\r\\nFor, if the tentative indications that the contraction\\r\\nphase of this business cycle is drawing to a close are\\r\\nultimately confirmed, we will have experienced a\\r\\nsignificantly milder downturn than the long history of\\r\\nbusiness cycles would have led us to expect. Crucially,\\r\\nthe imbalances that triggered the downturn and that\\r\\ncould have prolonged this difficult period did not fester. \\r\\nThe obvious questions are what has changed in our\\r\\neconomy in recent decades to provide such resilience\\r\\nand whether such changes will persist into the future.\\nDoubtless, the substantial improvement in the\\r\\naccess of business decisionmakers to real-time\\r\\ninformation has played a key role. Thirty years ago, the\\r\\ntimeliness of available information varied across\\r\\ncompanies and industries, often resulting in differences\\r\\nin the speed and magnitude of their responses to\\r\\nchanging business conditions. In contrast to the\\r\\nsituation that prevails today, businesses did not have\\r\\nreal-time data systems that enabled decisionmakers in\\r\\ndifferent enterprises to work from essentially the same\\r\\nset of information. In those earlier years, imbalances\\r\\nwere inadvertently allowed to build to such an extent\\r\\nthat their inevitable correction engendered significant\\r\\neconomic stress. That process of correction and the\\r\\naccompanying economic and financial disruptions too\\r\\noften led to deep and prolonged recessions. Today,\\r\\nbusinesses have large quantities of data available\\r\\nvirtually in real time. As a consequence, they address\\r\\nand resolve economic imbalances far more rapidly than\\r\\nin the past.\\n\\n\\nThe apparent increased flexibility of the American\\r\\neconomy arguably also reflects the extent of\\r\\nderegulation over the past quarter century. Certainly, if\\r\\nthe energy sector were still in the tight regulatory fetters\\r\\nof the 1970s, our flexibility today would be markedly\\r\\nless. That the collapse of Enron barely registered in the\\r\\nrelatively recently developed markets for natural gas\\r\\nand electric power was encouraging. Although the\\r\\nterrorist attacks hit air travel especially hard over the\\r\\npast few months, deregulation of that industry has\\r\\ndemonstrably increased the quantity and flexibility, if\\r\\nnot the profitability, of air travel over the past twenty\\r\\nyears. Trucking and rail deregulation has added\\r\\nflexibility to the movement of goods across our nation.  \\nBoth deregulation and innovation in the financial\\r\\nsector have been especially important in enhancing\\r\\noverall economic resilience. New financial\\r\\nproducts--including derivatives, asset-backed\\r\\nsecurities, collateralized loan obligations, and\\r\\ncollateralized mortgage obligations, among\\r\\nothers--have enabled risk to be dispersed more\\r\\neffectively to those willing to, and presumably capable\\r\\nof, bearing it. Shocks to the overall economic system\\r\\nare accordingly less likely to create cascading credit\\r\\nfailure. Lenders have the opportunity to be\\r\\nconsiderably more diversified, and borrowers are far\\r\\nless dependent on specific institutions for funds. \\r\\nFinancial derivatives, particularly, have grown at a\\r\\nphenomenal pace over the past fifteen years, evidently\\r\\nfulfilling a need to hedge risks that were not readily\\r\\ndeflected in earlier decades. Despite the concerns that\\r\\nthese complex instruments have induced (an issue I will\\r\\naddress shortly), the record of their performance,\\r\\nespecially over the past couple of stressful years,\\r\\nsuggests that on balance they have contributed to the\\r\\ndevelopment of a far more flexible and efficient financial\\r\\nsystem--both domestically and internationally--than\\r\\nwe had just twenty or thirty years ago.\\nAs a consequence of increased access to real-time\\r\\ninformation and, more arguably, extensive\\r\\nderegulation in financial and product markets and the\\r\\nunbundling of risk, imbalances are more likely to be\\r\\nreadily contained, and cyclical episodes overall should\\r\\nbe less severe than would be the case otherwise. If this\\r\\nis indeed the case--and it must be considered\\r\\nspeculative until more evidence is gathered--the\\r\\nimplied reduction in volatility, other things equal, would\\r\\nlower risk and equity premiums.\\nOther things, however, may not be wholly equal. \\r\\nThe very technologies that appear to be the\\r\\nmain cause of our apparent increased flexibility and\\r\\nresiliency may also be imparting different forms of\\r\\nvulnerability that could intensify or be intensified by a\\r\\nbusiness cycle.\\nFrom one perspective, the ever-increasing\\r\\nproportion of our GDP that represents conceptual as\\r\\ndistinct from physical value added may actually have\\r\\nlessened cyclical volatility. In particular, the fact that\\r\\nconcepts cannot be held as inventories means a greater\\r\\nshare of GDP is not subject to a type of dynamics that\\r\\namplifies cyclical swings. But an economy in which\\r\\nconcepts form an important share of valuation has its\\r\\nown vulnerabilities.\\nAs the recent events surrounding Enron have\\r\\nhighlighted, a firm is inherently fragile if its value added\\r\\nemanates more from conceptual as distinct from\\r\\nphysical assets. A physical asset, whether an office\\r\\nbuilding or an automotive assembly plant, has the\\r\\ncapability of producing goods even if the reputation of\\r\\nthe managers of such facilities falls under a cloud. The\\r\\nrapidity of Enron's decline is an effective illustration of\\r\\nthe vulnerability of a firm whose market value largely\\r\\nrests on capitalized reputation. The physical assets of\\r\\nsuch a firm comprise a small proportion of its asset\\r\\nbase. Trust and reputation can vanish overnight. A\\r\\nfactory cannot.\\nThe implications of such a loss of confidence\\r\\nfor the macroeconomy depend importantly on how\\r\\nfreely the conceptual capital of the fading firm can be\\r\\nreplaced by a competitor or a new entrant into the\\r\\nindustry. Even if entry is relatively free,\\r\\nmacroeconomic risks can emerge if problems at one\\r\\nparticular firm tend to make investors and\\r\\ncounterparties uncertain about other firms that they see\\r\\nas potentially similarly situated. The difficulty of valuing\\r\\nfirms that deal primarily with concepts and the growing\\r\\nsize and importance of these firms may make our\\r\\neconomy more susceptible to this type of contagion.\\nAnother, more conventional determinant of\\r\\nstability will be the economy's degree of leverage--the\\r\\nextent to which debt rather than equity is financing the\\r\\nlevel of capital. The proper degree of leverage in a\\r\\nfirm, or in an economy as a whole, is an inherently\\r\\nelusive figure that almost certainly changes from time to\\r\\ntime. Clearly, firms find some leverage advantageous in\\r\\nenhancing returns on equity, and thus moderate\\r\\nleverage undoubtedly boosts the capital stock and the\\r\\nlevel of output. A sophisticated financial system, with\\r\\nits substantial array of instruments to unbundle risks,\\r\\nwill tend toward a higher degree of leverage at any\\r\\ngiven level of underlying economic risk. But, the\\r\\ngreater the degree of leverage in any economy, the\\r\\ngreater its vulnerability to unexpected shortfalls in\\r\\ndemand and mistakes.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, on a historical cost basis, the ratio of\\r\\ndebt to net worth for the nonfinancial corporate\\r\\nbusiness sector did rise, from 71 percent at the end of\\r\\n1997 to about 81 percent at the end of the third quarter\\r\\nof last year, though it is still well below its level at the\\r\\nbeginning of the recession in 1990. The ratio of interest\\r\\npayments to cash flow, one indicator of the\\r\\nconsequence of leverage, has crept up in recent years,\\r\\nreflecting growth in debt. However, owing to lower\\r\\ninterest rates, it remains far below its levels of the early\\r\\n1990s.\\nAlthough the fears of business leverage have been\\r\\nmostly confined to specific sectors in recent years,\\r\\nconcerns over potential systemic problems resulting\\r\\nfrom the vast expansion of derivatives have reemerged\\r\\nwith the difficulties of Enron. To be sure, firms like\\r\\nEnron, and Long-Term Capital Management before it,\\r\\nwere major players in the derivatives markets. But\\r\\ntheir problems were readily traceable to an old\\r\\nfashioned excess of debt, however acquired, as well as\\r\\nto opaque accounting of that leverage and lax\\r\\ncounterparty scrutiny. Swaps and other derivatives\\r\\nthroughout their short history, including over the past\\r\\neighteen months, have been remarkably free of default. \\r\\nOf course, there can be latent problems in any market\\r\\nthat expands as rapidly as these markets have. \\r\\nRegulators and supervisors are particularly sensitive to\\r\\nthis possibility. Derivatives have provided greater\\r\\nflexibility to our financial system. But their very\\r\\ncomplexity could leave counterparties vulnerable to\\r\\nsignificant risk that they do not currently recognize, and\\r\\nhence these instruments potentially expose the overall\\r\\nsystem if mistakes are large. In that regard, the\\r\\nmarket's reaction to the revelations about Enron\\r\\nprovides encouragement that the force of market\\r\\ndiscipline can be counted on over time to foster much\\r\\ngreater transparency and increased clarity and\\r\\ncompleteness in the accounting treatment of derivatives.\\nHow these countervailing forces for stability\\r\\nevolve will surely be a major determinant of the\\r\\nvolatility that our economy will experience in the years\\r\\nahead. Monetary policy will have to be particularly\\r\\nsensitive to the possibility that the resiliency our\\r\\neconomy has exhibited during the past two years\\r\\nsignals subtle changes in the way our system functions.  \\nOur most recent experiences underscore this\\r\\npossibility, along with the persistence of a long list of\\r\\nolder, well-tested, economic verities. Inventories,\\r\\nespecially among producers and purchasers of\\r\\nhigh-tech products, did run to excess over the past\\r\\nyear, as sales forecasts went badly astray; alas,\\r\\ntechnology has not allowed us to see into the future any\\r\\nmore clearly than we could previously. But technology\\r\\ndid facilitate the quick recognition of the weakening in\\r\\nsales and backup of inventories. This enabled\\r\\nproducers to respond forcefully, as evidenced by\\r\\noutput adjustments that have resulted in the\\r\\nextraordinary rate of inventory liquidation we\\r\\nexperienced late last year.\\nFor the period just ahead, the central tendency\\r\\nof the forecasts of the members of the Federal Open\\r\\nMarket Committee is for real GDP to rise 2-1/2 to\\r\\n3 percent during 2002. Such a pace for the growth of\\r\\nreal output is somewhat below the rates of growth\\r\\ntypically seen early in previous expansions. Certain\\r\\nfactors, such as the lack of pent-up demand in the\\r\\nconsumer sector, significant levels of excess capacity in\\r\\na number of industries, weakness and financial fragility\\r\\nin some key international trading partners, and\\r\\npersistent caution in financial markets at home, seem\\r\\nlikely to restrain the near-term performance of the\\r\\neconomy.\\nIn line with past experience during the early\\r\\nstages of expansion, labor market performance is\\r\\nexpected initially to lag as firms rely primarily on\\r\\novertime and shifts from part-time to full-time work. \\r\\nThe unemployment rate is anticipated to rise somewhat\\r\\nfurther over 2002, to the area of 6 to 6-1/4 percent. \\r\\nFOMC members evidently anticipate that slack in\\r\\nresource utilization, the lagged effects of past declines in\\r\\nenergy prices, and productivity growth will keep\\r\\ninflation low this year, with the price index for personal\\r\\nconsumption expenditure increasing about 1-1/2\\r\\npercent.  \\nDespite its forecast that economic growth is likely\\r\\nto resume at a moderate pace, as I already noted,\\r\\nthe Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting on\\r\\nJanuary 30 saw the risks nonetheless as continuing to\\r\\nbe weighted mainly toward conditions that may\\r\\ngenerate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. \\r\\nIn effect, the FOMC indicated that until the dynamics\\r\\nof sustained expansion are more firmly in place, it\\r\\nremained concerned about the possibility of weak\\r\\ngrowth for a time, despite the very low level of the\\r\\nfederal funds rate.\\nAlthough there are ample reasons to be cautious\\r\\nabout the economic outlook, the recuperative\\r\\npowers of the U.S. economy, as I have tried to\\r\\nemphasize in my presentation, have been remarkable. \\r\\nWhen I presented our report on monetary policy to this\\r\\nCommittee last summer, few if any of us could have\\r\\nanticipated events such as those to which our nation has\\r\\nsubsequently been subjected. The economic\\r\\nconsequences of those events and their aftermath are\\r\\nan integral part of the many challenges that we now\\r\\ncollectively face. The U.S. economy has experienced a\\r\\nsubstantial shock, and, no doubt, we continue to face\\r\\nrisks in the period ahead. But the response thus far of\\r\\nour citizens to these new economic challenges provides\\r\\nreason for encouragement.\\n\\nFebruary 2002 Monetary policy report | 2002 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: February 27, 2002, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan -- Monetary policy report to the Congress, U.S. Senate -- July 16, 2002\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board\\'s semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate\\r\\nJuly 16, 2002\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 17, 2002\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nI appreciate this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the four and one-half months since I last testified before this Committee on monetary policy, the economy has continued to expand, largely along the broad contours we had anticipated at that time.  Although the uncertainties of earlier this year are as yet not fully resolved, the U.S. economy appears to have withstood a set of blows--major declines in equity markets, a sharp retrenchment in investment spending, and the tragic terrorist attacks of last September--that in previous business cycles almost surely would have induced a severe contraction.  The mildness and brevity of the downturn, as I indicated earlier this year, are a testament to the notable improvement in the resilience and flexibility of the U.S. economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while the economy has held up remarkably well, not surprisingly the depressing effects of recent events linger.  Spending will continue to adjust for some time to the declines that have occurred in equity prices.  In recent weeks, those prices have fallen further on net, in part under the influence of growing concerns about corporate governance and business transparency problems that evidently accumulated during the earlier rapid runup in these markets.  Considerable uncertainties--about the progress of the adjustment of capital spending and the rebound in profitability, about the potential for additional revelations of corporate malfeasance, and about possible risks from global political events and terrorism--still confront us. \\r\\n \\r\\nNevertheless, the fundamentals are in place for a return to sustained healthy growth:  Imbalances in inventories and capital goods appear largely to have been worked off; inflation is quite low and is expected to remain so; and productivity growth has been remarkably strong, implying considerable underlying support to household and business spending as well as potential relief from cost and price pressures.  In considering policy actions this year, the Federal Open Market Committee has recognized that the accommodative stance of policy adopted last year in response to the substantial forces restraining the economy likely will not prove compatible over time with maximum sustainable growth and price stability.  But, with inflation currently contained and with few signs that upward pressures are likely to develop any time soon, we have chosen to maintain that stance pending evidence that the forces inhibiting economic growth are dissipating enough to allow the strong fundamentals to show through more fully. \\r\\n\\r\\n As has often been the case in the past, the behavior of inventories provided substantial impetus for the initial strengthening of the economy.  Manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers took vigorous steps throughout 2001 to eliminate an unwanted buildup of stocks that emerged when final demand slowed late in 2000.  By early this year, with inventory levels having apparently come into better alignment with expected sales, the pace of inventory reduction began to ebb, and efforts to limit further drawdowns provided a considerable boost to production.  The available evidence suggests that, in some sectors, liquidation may be giving way to a rebuilding of inventories.  However, as inventories start to grow more in line with sales in coming quarters, the contribution of inventory investment to real GDP growth should lessen.  As a result, the strength of final demand will play its usual central role in determining the vigor of the expansion. While final demand has been increasing, the pace of forward momentum remains uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHousehold spending held up quite well during the downturn and through recent months, and thus served as an important stabilizing force for the overall economy.  Real consumer outlays and spending on residential construction each rose about 3 percent over the course of 2001, even as the growth of real GDP fell off to only ï¿½ percent.  Household spending was boosted by ongoing increases in incomes, which in turn were spurred by strong advances in productivity as well as by legislated tax reductions and, in recent months, by extended unemployment insurance benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonetary policy also played a role by cutting short-term interest rates, which helped lower household borrowing costs.  Particularly important in buoying spending were the very low levels of mortgage interest rates, which encouraged households to purchase homes, refinance debt and lower debt service burdens, and extract equity from homes to finance expenditures.  Fixed mortgage rates remain at historically low levels and thus should continue to fuel reasonably strong housing demand and, through equity extraction, to support consumer spending as well.  Indeed, recent sizable increases in home prices, which reflect the effects on demand of low mortgage rates, immigration, and shortages of buildable land in some areas, have significantly increased the equity in houses that homeowners can readily tap through home equity loans and mortgage refinancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut those sources of strength probably will be tempered by other influences.  As we noted in February, because consumer and residential expenditures did not decline during the overall downturn, there is little pent-up demand to be satisfied.  Consequently, a surge in household spending early in this recovery is unlikely.  Moreover, the declines in household wealth that have occurred over the past couple of years should continue to restrain spending in the period ahead.  Still, despite concerns about economic prospects, equity valuations, terrorism, and geopolitical conflicts, consumers do not appear to have retrenched in retail markets.  Indeed, consumers responded strongly to the new interest rate incentives of motor vehicle manufacturers this month.  Early reports indicate a significant improvement in sales over June.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nBy contrast, business spending has been depressed.  The recent economic downturn was driven, in large measure, by the sharp falloff in the demand for capital goods that occurred when firms suddenly realized that stocks of such goods--both those already in place as well as those in inventory--were excessive.  The resulting declines in the production of capital goods were particularly sizable in the high-tech sector.  Monthly shipments of computers and peripherals, for example, fell by about 40 percent from their peak in 1999 through their trough in 2001.  Sales by communications equipment producers slumped just as sharply.  Outside the high-tech sector, production also declined.  Assemblies of commercial aircraft slowed abruptly.  In addition, the construction of office and industrial buildings fell off noticeably.  The collapse of many Internet firms and the difficulties of the high-tech sector more generally led to a significant drop in the demand for office space that was exacerbated as the economic slowdown widened beyond the tech sector.  Overall, the level of real business fixed investment plunged about 11 percent between its quarterly peak in the final months of 2000 and the first quarter of this year.  \\r\\n \\r\\nWith the adjustment of the capital stock to desired levels now evidently well advanced, business fixed investment may be set to improve.  A recovery in this category of spending is likely to be gradual by historical standards and uneven across sectors.  For example, an upturn in production of semiconductors and computers has been under way now for nearly a year, but with significant overcapacity still prevailing in some segments of the telecom industry, investment in communications equipment is likely to remain subdued for some time to come.  Overall capital expenditures should strengthen with time.  In particular, firms should respond increasingly to the expected improvement in the outlook for sales and profits, low debt financing costs, the heightened incentives resulting from the partial expensing tax provisions legislated earlier this year, and especially the productivity enhancements offered by continuing advances in technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, despite the recent depressed level of investment expenditures, the productivity of the U.S. economy has continued to rise at a remarkably strong pace.  In the nonfarm business sector, output per hour is currently estimated to have soared at an average annual rate of about 7 percent over the fourth quarter of 2001 and first quarter of 2002, and the available evidence points to continued gains last quarter--though not at the frenetic pace of the preceding half year.  In part, these increases in productivity reflect the very cautious attitudes of managers toward hiring.  But the magnitude of the recent gains would not have been possible without ongoing benefits from the rapid pace of technological advance and from the heavy investment over the latter half of the 1990s in capital equipment incorporating such advances.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these encouraging developments regarding the longer-term prospects for the economy, financial markets have been notably skittish of late, and business managers remain decidedly cautious.  In part, these attitudes reflect the lingering effects of the shocks that our economy endured in 2000 and 2001.  Particularly given the dimensions of those shocks, some persistent uncertainty and concern are not surprising.\\r\\n \\r\\nAlso contributing to the dispirited attitudes among many corporate executives is the intensely competitive business environment facing their firms.  Increased competition, while producing manifold benefits for consumers and for the economy as a whole, clearly makes individual firms\\' operations more difficult.  Past deregulation and, more recently, the enhanced speed and efficiency of information flows resulting from technological advances are strengthening competition domestically.  In addition, globalization is intensifying competition in a broad range of markets and damping pricing power across developed and developing nations alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose businesses where heightened competition has engendered a loss of pricing power have sought ways to raise profit margins by employing technology to lower costs and improve efficiency.  In the United States, as a consequence of the interaction of monetary policy, globalization, and cost-reducing productivity advances, price inflation has fallen in recent years to its lowest level in four decades, as has the recent growth rate of nominal GDP and consolidated corporate revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn part because nominal corporate revenues, although no longer declining, are growing only tepidly, managers seem to remain skeptical of the evidence of an emerging upturn.  Profit margins do appear to be coming off their lows registered late last year, but, unsurprisingly, the recovery in economic activity from a shallow decline appears less vigorous than in the past.  The lowest sustained rates of inflation in forty years imply that nominal growth in sales and profits looks particularly anemic.  In contrast, in the 1950s and early 1960s, the last period of stable prices, populations and employment were growing considerably faster than the recent pace so that growth in nominal GDP, consolidated corporate sales, and profits was seen as still quite respectable.  Reflecting concerns about the strength of the recovery, managers continue to limit capital spending to only the most pressing needs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nGiven the key role of perceptions of subdued profitability in the current period, it is ironic that the practice of not expensing stock-option grants, which contributed to the surge in earnings reported to shareholders from 1997 to 2000, has imparted a deceptive weakness to the growth of earnings reported to shareholders in recent quarters.  As stock market gains turned to losses a couple of years ago, the willingness of employees to accept stock options in lieu of cash or other forms of compensation apparently diminished.  According to estimates by Federal Reserve staff, the value of stock option grants for the S&P 500 corporations fell about 15 percent from 2000 to 2001, and grant values have likely declined still further this year.  Moreover, options grants are presumably being replaced over time by cash or other forms of compensation, which are expensed, contributing further to less robust growth in earnings reported to shareholders from its trough last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, the measure of profits calculated by the Department of Commerce for the National Income and Product Accounts is designed to gauge the economic profitability of current operations.  It excludes a number of one-time charges that appear in shareholder reports, and, importantly, records options as an expense, albeit at the time of exercise.  Although this treatment of the cost of options is not ideal, it is arguably superior to their treatment in shareholder reports, where options are generally not expensed at all.  NIPA profits closely approximate those obtained from reports submitted for tax purposes, and, for obvious reasons, corporations tend not to inflate taxable earnings.  Consequently, NIPA profits have been far less subject to the spin evident in reports to shareholders in recent years.  NIPA profits have increased sharply since the third quarter of last year, partly reflecting the dramatic jump in productivity and decline in unit labor costs.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe difficulties of judging earnings trends have been intensified by revelations of misleading accounting practices at some prominent businesses.  The resulting investor skepticism about earnings reports has not only depressed the valuation of equity shares, but it also has been reportedly a factor in the rising risk spreads on corporate debt issued by the lower rung of investment-grade and below-investment grade firms, further elevating the cost of capital for these borrowers.   Businesses concerned about the impact of possible adverse publicity regarding their accounting practices on their access to finance could revert to a much heavier emphasis on cash generation and accumulation.  Such an emphasis could slow new capital investment initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent impressive advances in productivity suggest that to date any impairment of efficiency of U. S. corporations overall has been small.  Efficiency is of course a key measure of corporate governance.  Nonetheless, the danger that breakdowns in governance could at some point significantly erode business efficiency remains worrisome.  Well-functioning markets require accurate information to allocate capital and other resources, and market participants must have confidence that our predominately voluntary system of exchange is transparent and fair.   Although business transactions are governed by laws and contracts, if even a modest fraction of those transactions had to be adjudicated, our courts would be swamped into immobility.  Thus, our market system depends critically on trust--trust in the word of our colleagues and trust in the word of those with whom we do business.  Falsification and fraud are highly destructive to free-market capitalism and, more broadly, to the underpinnings of our society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, shareholders and potential investors would have been protected from widespread misinformation if any one of the many bulwarks safeguarding appropriate corporate evaluation had held.  In too many cases, none did.  Lawyers, internal and external auditors, corporate boards, Wall Street security analysts, rating agencies, and large institutional holders of stock all failed for one reason or another to detect and blow the whistle on those who breached the level of trust essential to well-functioning markets.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy did corporate governance checks and balances that served us reasonably well in the past break down?  At root was the rapid enlargement of stock market capitalizations in the latter part of the 1990s that arguably engendered an outsized increase in opportunities for avarice.  An infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business community.  Our historical guardians of financial information were overwhelmed.  Too many corporate executives sought ways to \"harvest\" some of those stock market gains.  As a result, the highly desirable spread of shareholding and options among business managers perversely created incentives to artificially inflate reported earnings in order to keep stock prices high and rising.  This outcome suggests that the options were poorly structured, and, consequently, they failed to properly align the long-term interests of shareholders and managers, the paradigm so essential for effective corporate governance.  The incentives they created overcame the good judgment of too many corporate managers.  It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past.  It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the recent breakdown of protective barriers resulted from a once-in-a-generation frenzy of speculation that is now over.  With profitable opportunities for malfeasance markedly diminished, far fewer questionable practices are likely to be initiated in the immediate future.  To be sure, previously undiscovered misdeeds will no doubt continue to surface in the weeks ahead as chastened CEOs restate earnings.  But even if the worst is over, history cautions us that memories fade.  Thus, it is incumbent upon us to apply the lessons of this recent period to inhibit any recurrence in the future.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nA major focus of reform of corporate governance, of course, should be an improved functioning of our economy.  A related, but separate, issue is that shareholders must perceive that corporate governance is properly structured so that financial gains are fairly negotiated between existing shareholders and corporate officeholders.  Shareholding is now predominately for investment, not corporate control.  Our vast and highly liquid financial markets enable large institutional shareholders to sell their shares when they perceive inadequacies of corporate governance, rather than fix them.  This has placed de facto control in the hands of the chief executive officer.  Shareholders routinely authorize slates of directors recommended by the CEO.  Generally, problems need to become quite large before CEOs are dislodged by dissenting shareholders or hostile takeovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nManifestations of lax corporate governance, in my judgment, are largely a symptom of a failed CEO.  Having independent directors, whose votes are not controlled by the CEO, is essential, of course, for any effective board of directors.  However, we need to be careful that in the process, we do not create a competing set of directors and conflicting sources of power that are likely to impair a corporation\\'s effectiveness.  The functioning of any business requires a central point of authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, a CEO must be afforded full authority to implement corporate strategies, but also must bear the responsibility to accurately report the resulting condition of the corporation to shareholders and potential investors.  Unless such responsibilities are enforced with very stiff penalties for non-compliance, as many now recommend, our accounting systems and other elements of corporate governance will function in a less than optimum manner.\\r\\n \\r\\nAlready existing statutes, of course, prohibit corporate fraud and misrepresentation.  But even a small increase in the likelihood of large, possibly criminal penalties for egregious behavior of CEOs can have profoundly important effects on all aspects of corporate governance because the fulcrum of governance is the chief executive officer.  If a CEO countenances managing reported earnings, that attitude will drive the entire accounting regime of the firm.  If he or she instead insists on an objective representation of a company\\'s business dealings, that standard will govern recordkeeping and due diligence.  It has been my experience on numerous corporate boards that CEOs who insist that their auditors render objective accounts get them.  And CEOs who discourage corner-cutting by subordinates are rarely exposed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognize that I am saying that the state of corporate governance to a very large extent reflects the character of the CEO, and that this is a very difficult issue to address.  Although we may not be able to change the character of corporate officers, we can change behavior through incentives and penalties.  That, in my judgment, could dramatically improve the state of corporate governance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur most recent experiences clearly indicate, however, that adjustments to the existing structure of regulation of corporate governance and accounting beyond addressing the role of the CEO are needed.  In designing changes to our regulatory framework, we should keep in mind that regulation and supervision of our financial markets need to be flexible enough to adapt to an ever-changing and evolving financial structure.  Regulation cannot be static or it will soon distort the efficient flow of capital from savers to those who invest in plant and equipment.  There will be certain areas where Congress will choose to provide a specific statutory direction that will be as applicable thirty years from now as today.  In other cases, agency rule-making flexibility under new or existing statutes is more appropriate.  Finally, there are some areas where private supervision would be most effective, such as that of the New York Stock Exchange, which requires certain standards of governance for listing.\\r\\n \\r\\nAbove all, we must bear in mind that the critical issue should be how to strengthen the legal base of free market capitalism:  the property rights of shareholders and other owners of capital.  Fraud and deception are thefts of property.  In my judgment, more generally, unless the laws governing how markets and corporations function are perceived as fair, our economic system cannot achieve its full potential.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t*   *   *\\n\\r\\nA considerable volume of market commentary in recent weeks has suggested that concerns about earnings prospects and the proliferating revelations of serious governance and accounting issues have contributed not only to lower equity prices but also to a decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  And some of that commentary has extrapolated the trend of dollar weakness.  As you know, the Secretary of the Treasury speaks for our government on exchange rate policy.  But, given the recent intense interest in the future course of the dollar, I would like to raise a technical issue and a flag of caution regarding those forecasts--or, for that matter, any forecast of exchange rates.  There may be more forecasting of exchange rates, with less success, than almost any other economic variable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason that it is so difficult is that an exchange rate is a very complex price that balances, on the one hand, the demand for, for example, dollars stemming from the demand for dollar investments and for U.S. exports against, on the other hand, the demand for foreign currencies by U.S. investors desiring to acquire foreign assets and by U.S. importers of foreign goods and services.  Hence, exchange-rate movements depend on shifting perceptions of the relative returns from investing in different countries and on the myriad influences on relative tendencies to import and export.  The net effect of these factors over any future time period is extraordinarily difficult to assess in advance.  Although measures such as real interest rate differentials, differential rates of productivity gains, and chronic external deficits are often employed to explain exchange rate behavior, none has been found to be consistently useful in forecasting exchange rates even over substantial periods of one or two years.\\r\\n \\r\\nOur ability to attract foreign capital in coming years will help facilitate the increases in investment that will promote continued gains in productivity and standards of living.  But policymakers should also recognize the important role that prudent fiscal policy can play in promoting national saving and maintaining conditions conducive to investment and continued strong growth of productivity.  Beginning in the late 1980s, impressive progress was made in reining in federal expenditures and restoring a better balance between spending and revenues.   The lower federal deficits and, for a time, the realization of surpluses contributed significantly to improved national saving and thereby put downward pressure on real interest rates.  This, in turn, enhanced the incentives of businesses to invest in productive plant and equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, however, some of those gains have been given up.  To a degree, the return to budget deficits has been a result of temporary factors, especially the falloff in revenues and the increase in outlays associated with the economic downturn.  Those influences should tend to reverse over the next year or two, other things equal, although the decline in revenues reflecting the drop in capital gains realizations, including those on options, is unlikely to be fully reversed.  And the necessary rise in expenditures related to the war on terrorism and enhanced homeland security has also played a role, as have the tax reductions legislated last year.  Unfortunately, there are also signs that the underlying disciplinary mechanisms that formed the framework for federal budget decisions over most of the past fifteen years have eroded.  The Administration and the Congress can make a valuable contribution to the prospects for the growth of the economy by taking measures to restore this discipline and return the federal budget over time to a posture that is supportive of long-term economic growth.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo sum up, the U.S. economy has confronted very significant challenges over the past year or so.  Those problems, however, led to only a relatively brief and mild downturn in economic activity, reflecting the underlying strength and increased resiliency that the economy has achieved in recent years.  The effects of the recent difficulties will linger for a bit longer but, as they wear off, and absent significant further adverse shocks, the U.S. economy is poised to resume a pattern of sustainable growth.  Indeed, the central tendency of Federal Reserve policymakers\\' forecasts is for expansion of real GDP over the four quarters of 2002 of 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent, somewhat above the rates anticipated in our February report.  Economic growth is projected to be solid again next year, with real output rising 3-1/2 to 4 percent.  Monetary policymakers anticipate that these gains should be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent by the end of next year.  Inflation is expected to be subdued throughout, with prices for personal consumption expenditures increasing at only a 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent rate.  Our prospects for extending this performance over time can be enhanced through implementation of sound monetary, financial, fiscal, and trade policies.\\r\\n\\n\\nJuly 2002 Monetary policy report | 2002 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 17, 2002, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Monetary Policy Report to the Congress-- February 28, 2001\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board’s semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives \\r\\nFebruary 28, 2001\\n\\r\\nThis presentation updates the testimony given by Chairman Greenspan before the Committee\\r\\non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 13, 2001\\r\\n\\r\\nI appreciate the opportunity this morning to present the\\r\\nFederal Reserve's semiannual report on monetary policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe past decade has been extraordinary for the American economy and monetary policy.  The synergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the underlying growth rate of productivity.  The capitalization of those higher expected returns boosted equity prices, contributing to a substantial pickup in household spending on new homes, durable goods, and other types of consumption generally, beyond even that implied by the enhanced rise in real incomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhen I last reported to you in July, economic growth was just exhibiting initial signs of slowing from what had been an exceptionally rapid and unsustainable rate of increase that began a year earlier. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe surge in spending had lifted the growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goods and business capital equipment to rates that could not be continued.  The elevated level of light vehicle sales, for example, implied a rate of increase in the number of vehicles on the road hardly sustainable for a mature industry.  And even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on even faster.  Overall, capacity in high-tech manufacturing industries rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in excess of its rapid rate of increase over the previous three years.  Hence, a temporary glut in these industries and falling prospective rates of return were inevitable at some point.  Clearly, some slowing in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the economy was to progress along a balanced and sustainable growth path.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut the adjustment has occurred much faster than most businesses anticipated, with the process likely intensified by the rise in the cost of energy that has drained business and household purchasing power.  Purchases of durable goods and investment in capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter.  Because the extent of the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses, it induced some backup in inventories, despite the more advanced just-in-time technologies that have in recent years enabled firms to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in demand.  Inventory-sales ratios rose only moderately; but relative to the levels of these ratios implied by their downtrend over the past decade, the emerging imbalances appeared considerably larger.  Reflecting these growing imbalances, manufacturing purchasing managers reported last month that inventories in the hands of their customers had risen to excessively high levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a result, a round of inventory rebalancing appears to be in progress.  Accordingly, the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of 2000 intensified, perhaps even to the point of growth stalling out around the turn of the year.  As the economy slowed, equity prices fell, especially in the high-tech sector, where previous high valuations and optimistic forecasts were being reevaluated, resulting in significant losses for some investors.  In addition, lenders turned more cautious.  This tightening of financial conditions, itself, contributed to restraint on spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tAgainst this background, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) undertook a series of aggressive monetary policy steps.  At its December meeting, the FOMC shifted its announced assessment of the balance of risks to express concern about economic weakness, which encouraged declines in market interest rates.  Then on January 3, and again on January 31, the FOMC reduced its targeted federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point, to its current level of 5-1/2 percent.  An essential precondition for this type of response was that underlying cost and price pressures remained subdued, so that our front-loaded actions were unlikely to jeopardize the stable, low inflation environment necessary to foster investment and advances in productivity.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith signs of softness still patently in evidence at the time of its January meeting, the FOMC retained its sense that downside risks predominate.  The exceptional degree of slowing so evident toward the end of last year (perhaps in part the consequence of adverse weather) seemed less evident in January and February.  Nonetheless, the economy appears to be on a track well below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential and, even after the policy actions we took in January, the risks continue skewed toward the economy's remaining on a path inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCrucial to the assessment of the outlook and the understanding of recent policy actions is the role of technological change and productivity in shaping near-term cyclical forces as well as long-term sustainable growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe prospects for sustaining strong advances in productivity in the years ahead remain favorable.  As one would expect, productivity growth has slowed along with the economy.  But what is notable is that, during the second half of 2000, output per hour advanced at a pace sufficiently impressive to provide strong support for the view that the rate of growth of structural productivity remains well above its pace of a decade ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, although recent short-term business profits have softened considerably, most corporate managers appear not to have altered to any appreciable extent their long-standing optimism about the future returns from using new technology.  A recent survey of purchasing managers suggests that the wave of new on-line business-to-business activities is far from cresting.  Corporate managers more generally, rightly or wrongly, appear to remain remarkably sanguine about the potential for innovations to continue to enhance productivity and profits.  At least this is what is gleaned from the projections of equity analysts, who, one must presume, obtain most of their insights from corporate managers.  According to one prominent survey, the three- to five-year average earnings projections of more than a thousand analysts, though exhibiting some signs of diminishing in recent months, have generally held at a very high level.  Such expectations, should they persist, bode well for continued strength in capital accumulation and sustained elevated growth of structural productivity over the longer term.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe same forces that have been boosting growth in structural productivity seem also to have accelerated the process of cyclical adjustment.  Extraordinary improvements in business-to-business communication have held unit costs in check, in part by greatly speeding up the flow of information.  New technologies for supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing imply that businesses can perceive imbalances in inventories at a very early stage--virtually in real time--and can cut production promptly in response to the developing signs of unintended inventory building.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOur most recent experience with some inventory backup, of course, suggests that surprises can still occur and that this process is still evolving.  Nonetheless, compared with the past, much progress is evident.  A couple of decades ago, inventory data would not have been available to most firms until weeks had elapsed, delaying a response and, hence, eventually requiring even deeper cuts in production.  In addition, the foreshortening of lead times on delivery of capital equipment, a result of information and other newer technologies, has engendered a more rapid adjustment of capital goods production to shifts in demand that result\\r\\nfrom changes in firms' expectations of sales and profitability.  A decade ago, extended backlogs on capital equipment meant a more stretched-out process of production adjustments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEven consumer spending decisions have become increasingly responsive to changes in the perceived profitability of firms through their effects on the value of households' holdings of equities.  Stock market wealth has risen substantially relative to income in recent years--itself a reflection of the extraordinary surge of innovation.  As a consequence, changes in stock market wealth have become a more important determinant of shifts in consumer spending relative to changes in current household income than was the case just five to seven years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe hastening of the adjustment to emerging imbalances is generally beneficial.  It means that those imbalances are not allowed to build until they require very large corrections.  But the faster adjustment process does raise some warning flags.  Although the newer technologies have clearly allowed firms to make more informed decisions, business managers throughout the economy also are likely responding to much of the same enhanced body of information.  As a consequence, firms appear to be acting in far closer alignment with one another than in decades past.  The result is not only a faster adjustment, but one that is potentially more synchronized, compressing changes into an even shorter time frame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis very rapidity with which the current adjustment is proceeding raises another concern, of a different nature.  While technology has quickened production adjustments, human nature remains unaltered.  We respond to a heightened pace of change and its associated uncertainty in the same way we always have.  We withdraw from action, postpone decisions, and generally hunker down until a renewed, more comprehensible basis for acting emerges.  In its extreme manifestation, many economic decisionmakers not only become risk averse but attempt to disengage from all risk.  This precludes taking any initiative, because risk is inherent in every action.  In the fall of 1998, for example, the desire for liquidity became so intense that financial markets seized up.  Indeed, investors even tended to shun risk-free, previously issued Treasury securities in favor of highly liquid, recently issued Treasury securities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut even when decisionmakers are only somewhat more risk averse, a process of retrenchment can occur.  Thus, although prospective long-term returns on new high-tech investment may change little, increased uncertainty can induce a higher discount of those returns and, hence, a reduced willingness to commit liquid resources to illiquid fixed investments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSuch a process presumably is now under way and arguably may take some time to run its course.  It is not that underlying demand for Internet, networking, and communications services has become less keen.  Instead, as I noted earlier, some suppliers seem to have reacted late to accelerating demand, have overcompensated in response, and then have been forced to retrench--a not-unusual occurrence in business decisionmaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA pace of change outstripping the ability of people to adjust is just as evident among consumers as among business decisionmakers.  When consumers become less secure in their jobs and finances, they retrench as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIt is difficult for economic policy to deal with the abruptness of a break in confidence.  There may not be a seamless transition from high to moderate to low confidence on the part of businesses, investors, and consumers.  Looking back at recent cyclical episodes, we see that the change in attitudes has often been sudden.  In earlier testimony, I likened this process to water backing up against a dam that is finally breached.  The torrent carries with it most remnants of certainty and euphoria that built up in earlier periods.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis unpredictable rending of confidence is one reason that recessions are so difficult to forecast.  They may not be just changes in degree from a period of economic expansion, but a different process engendered by fear.  Our economic models have never been particularly successful in capturing a process driven in large part by nonrational behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor this reason, changes in consumer confidence will require close scrutiny in the period ahead, especially after the steep falloff of recent months.  But for now, at least, the weakness in sales of motor vehicles and homes has been modest, suggesting that consumers have retained enough confidence to make longer-term commitments; and, as I pointed out earlier, expected earnings growth over the longer-run continues to be elevated.  Obviously, if the forces contributing to long-term productivity growth remain intact, the degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited.  In that event, prospects for high productivity growth should, with time, bolster both consumption and investment demand.  Before long in this scenario, excess inventories would be run off to desired levels.  Higher demand should also facilitate the \\r\\nworking-off of a presumed excess capital stock, though, doubtless, at a more modest pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tStill, as the FOMC noted in its last announcement, for the period ahead, downside risks predominate.  In addition to the possibility of a break in confidence, we don't know how far the adjustment of the stocks of consumer durables and business capital equipment has come.  Also, foreign economies appear to be slowing, which could damp demands for exports; and continued nervousness is evident in the behavior of participants in financial markets, keeping risk spreads relatively elevated.   \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause the advanced supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing technologies may have quickened the pace of adjustment in production and incomes and correspondingly increased the stress on confidence, the Federal Reserve has seen the need to respond more aggressively than had been our wont in earlier decades.  Economic policymaking could not, and should not, remain unaltered in the face of major changes in the speed of economic processes.  Fortunately, the very advances in technology that have quickened economic adjustments have also enhanced our capacity for real-time surveillance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs I pointed out earlier, demand has been depressed by the rise in energy prices as well as by the needed slowing in the pace of accumulation of business capital and consumer durable assets.  The sharp rise in energy costs pressed down on profit margins still further in the fourth quarter.  About a quarter of the rise in total unit costs of nonfinancial, nonenergy corporations reflected a rise in energy costs.  The 12 percent rise in natural gas prices last quarter contributed directly, and indirectly through its effects on the cost of electrical power generation, about one-fourth of the rise in overall energy costs for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations; increases in oil prices accounted for the remainder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, a significant part of the margin squeeze not directly attributable to higher energy costs probably has reflected the effects of the moderation in consumer outlays that, in turn, has been due in part to higher costs of energy, especially for natural gas.  Hence, it is likely that energy cost increases contributed significantly more to the deteriorating profitability of nonfinancial, non-energy corporations in the fourth quarter than is suggested by the energy-related rise in total unit costs alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo be sure, the higher energy expenses of households and most businesses represent a transfer of income to producers of energy.  But the capital investment of domestic energy producers, and, very likely, consumption by their owners, have provided only a small offset to the constraining effects of higher energy costs on spending by most Americans.  Moreover, a significant part of the extra expense is sent overseas to foreign energy producers, whose demand for exports from the United States is unlikely to rise enough to compensate for the reduction in domestic spending, especially in the short-run.  Thus, given the evident inability of energy users, constrained by intense competition for their own products, to pass on much of their cost increases, the rise in energy costs does not appear to have had broad inflationary effects, in contrast to some previous episodes when inflation expectations were not as well anchored.  Rather, the most prominent effects have been to depress aggregate demand.  The recent decline in energy prices and further declines anticipated by futures markets, should they occur, would tend to boost purchasing power and be an important factor supporting a recovery in demand growth over coming quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn summary, then, although the sources of long-term strength of our economy remain in place, excesses built up in 1999 and early 2000 have engendered a retrenchment that has yet to run its full course.  This retrenchment has been prompt, in part because new technologies have enabled businesses to respond more rapidly to emerging excesses.  Accordingly, to foster financial conditions conducive to the economy's realizing its long-term strengths, the Federal Reserve has quickened the pace of adjustment of its policy.\\r\\n\\nFebruary 2001 Monetary Policy Report | 2001 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: February 28, 2001, 9:30 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan -- Monetary policy report to the Congress -- July 18, 2001\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nFederal Reserve Board’s semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives \\r\\nJuly 18, 2001\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 24, 2001\\n\\r\\nI appreciate the opportunity this morning to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual report on monetary policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMonetary policy this year has confronted an economy that slowed sharply late last year and has remained weak this year, following an extraordinary period of buoyant expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy aggressively easing the stance of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has moved to support demand and, we trust, help lay the groundwork for the economy to achieve maximum sustainable growth.  Our accelerated action reflected the pronounced downshift in economic activity, which was accentuated by the especially prompt and synchronous adjustment of production by businesses utilizing the faster flow of information coming from the adoption of new technologies.  A rapid and sizable easing was made possible by reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations, which helped to keep underlying inflation at a modest rate, and by the prospect that inflation would remain contained as resource utilization eased and energy prices backed down.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition to the more accommodative stance of monetary policy, demand should be assisted going forward by the effects of the tax cut, by falling energy costs, by the spur to production once businesses work down their inventories to more comfortable levels, and, most important, by the inducement to resume increases in capital spending.  That inducement should be provided by the continuation of cost-saving opportunities associated with rapid technological innovation.  Such innovation has been the driving force raising the growth of structural productivity over the last half-dozen years.  To be sure, measured productivity has softened in recent quarters, but by no more than one would anticipate from cyclical influences layered on top of a faster long-term trend. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut the uncertainties surrounding the current economic situation are considerable, and, until we see more concrete evidence that the adjustments of inventories and capital spending are well along, the risks would seem to remain mostly tilted toward weakness in the economy.  Still, the FOMC opted for a smaller policy move at our last meeting because we recognized that the effects of policy actions are felt with a lag, and, with our cumulative 2-3/4 percentage points of easing this year, we have moved a considerable distance in the direction of monetary stimulus.  Certainly, should conditions warrant, we may need to ease further, but we must not lose sight of the prerequisite of longer-run price stability for realizing the economy's full growth potential over time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tDespite the recent economic slowdown, the past decade has been extraordinary for the American economy.  The synergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the growth rate of structural productivity.  The capitalization of those higher expected returns lifted equity prices, which in turn contributed to a substantial pickup in household spending on a broad range of goods and services, especially on new homes and durable goods.  This increase in spending by both households and businesses exceeded even the enhanced rise in real household incomes and business earnings.  The evident attractiveness of investment opportunities in the United States induced substantial inflows of funds from abroad, raising the dollar's exchange rate while financing a growing portion of domestic spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy early 2000, the surge in household and business purchases had increased growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goods and business capital equipment to rates that could not be sustained.  Even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in some cases new supply was coming on even faster.  Overall, capacity in high-tech manufacturing industries, for example, rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in excess of its already rapid rate of increase over the previous three years.  Hence, a temporary glut in these industries and falling short-term prospective rates of return were inevitable at some point.  This tendency was reinforced by a more realistic evaluation of the prospects for returns on some high-tech investments, which, while still quite elevated by historical standards, apparently could not measure up to the previous exaggerated hopes.  Moreover, as I testified before this Committee last year, the economy as a whole was growing at an unsustainable pace, drawing further on an already diminished pool of available workers and relying increasingly on savings from abroad.  Clearly, some moderation in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the economy was to progress along a more balanced growth path. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t In the event, the adjustment occurred much faster than most businesses anticipated, with the slowdown likely intensified by the rise in the cost of energy that until quite recently had drained businesses and households of purchasing power.  Growth of outlays of consumer durable goods slowed in the middle of 2000, and shipments of nondefense capital goods have declined since autumn. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, weakness emerged more recently among our trading partners in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.  The interaction of slowdowns in a number of countries simultaneously has magnified the softening each of the individual economies would have experienced on its own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause the extent of the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses, some backup in inventories occurred, especially in the United States.  Innovations, such as more advanced supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing technologies, have enabled firms to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in sales.  But these improvements apparently have not solved the thornier problem of correctly anticipating demand.  Although inventory-sales ratios in most industries rose only moderately, those measures should be judged against businesses' desired levels.  In this regard, extrapolation of the downtrend in inventory-sales ratios over the past decade suggests that considerable imbalances emerged late last year.  Confirming this impression, purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector reported in January that inventories in the hands of their customers had risen to excessively high levels. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a result, a round of inventory rebalancing was undertaken, and the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of 2000 intensified.  The adjustment process started late last year when manufacturers began to cut production to stem the accumulation of unwanted inventories.  But inventories did not actually begin falling until early this year as producers decreased output levels considerably further. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMuch of the inventory reduction in the first quarter reflected a dramatic scaling back of motor vehicle assemblies.   However, inventories of computers, semiconductors, and communications products continued to build into the first quarter, and these stocks are only belatedly being brought under control.  As best we can judge, some progress seems to have been made on inventories of semiconductors and computers, but little gain is apparent with respect to communications equipment.  Inventories of high-tech products overall have probably been reduced a bit, but a period of substantial liquidation of stocks still seemingly lies ahead for these products. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor all inventories, the rate of liquidation appears to have been especially pronounced this winter, and the available data suggest that it continued, though perhaps at a more moderate pace, this spring.  A not inconsequential proportion of the current liquidation undoubtedly is of imported products, and thus will presumably affect foreign production, but most of the adjustment has fallen on domestic producers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAt some point, inventory liquidation will come to an end, and its termination will spur production and incomes.  Of course, the timing and force with which that process of recovery plays out will depend on the behavior of final demand.  In that regard, the demand for capital equipment, particularly in the near term, could pose a continuing problem.  Despite evidence that expected long-term rates of return on the newer technologies remain high, growth of investment in equipment and software has turned decidedly negative.  Sharp increases in uncertainties about the short-term outlook have significantly foreshortened the time frame over which businesses are requiring new capital projects to pay off.  The consequent heavier discounts applied to those long-term expectations have induced a major scaling back of new capital spending initiatives, though one that presumably is not long-lasting given the continuing inducements to embody improving technologies in new capital equipment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, a deterioration in sales, profitability, and cash flow has exacerbated the weakness in capital spending.  Pressures on profit margins have been unrelenting.  Although earnings weakness has been most pronounced for high-tech firms, where the previous extraordinary pace of expansion left oversupply in its wake, weakness is evident virtually across the board, including most recently in earnings of the foreign affiliates of American firms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMuch of the squeeze on profit margins of domestic operations results from a rise in unit labor costs.  Gains in compensation per hour picked up over the past year or so, responding to a long period of tight labor markets, the earlier acceleration of productivity, and the effects of an energy-induced run-up in consumer prices.  The faster upward movement in hourly compensation, coupled with the cyclical slowdown in the growth of output per hour, has elevated the rate of increase in unit labor costs.  In part, fixed costs, nonlabor as well as labor, are being spread over a smaller production base for many industries. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe surge in energy costs has also pressed down on profit margins, especially in the fourth and first quarters.  In fact, a substantial portion of the rise in total costs of domestic nonfinancial corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected the increase in energy costs.  The decline in energy prices since the spring, however, should be contributing positively to margins in the third quarter.  Moreover, the rate of increase in compensation is likely to moderate, with inflation expectations contained and labor markets becoming less taut in response to the slower pace of growth in economic activity.  In addition, continued rapid gains in structural productivity should help to suppress the rise in unit labor costs over time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEventually, the high-tech correction will abate, and these industries will reestablish themselves as a solidly expanding, though less frenetic, part of our economy.  When they do, growth in that sector presumably will not return to the outsized 50 percent annual growth rates of last year, but rather to a more sustainable pace. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOf course, investment spending ultimately depends on the strength of consumer demand for goods and services.  Here, too, longer-run increases in real incomes of consumers  engendered by the rapid advances in structural productivity should provide support to demand over time.  And thus far this year, consumer spending has indeed risen further, presumably assisted in part by a continued rapid growth in the market value of homes, from which a significant amount of equity is being extracted.  Moreover, household disposable income is now being bolstered by tax cuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut there are also downside risks to consumer spending over the next few quarters.  Importantly, the same pressure on profits and the heightened sense of risk that have held down investment have also lowered equity prices and reduced household wealth despite the rise in home equity.  We can expect the decline in stock market wealth that has occurred over the past year to restrain the growth of household spending relative to income, just as the previous increase gave an extra spur to household demand.  Furthermore, while most survey measures suggest consumer sentiment has stabilized recently, softer job markets could induce a further deterioration in confidence and spending intentions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhile this litany of risks should not be downplayed, it is notable how well the U.S. economy has withstood the many negative forces weighing on it.  Economic activity has held up remarkably in the face of a difficult adjustment toward a more sustainable pattern of expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe economic developments of the last couple of years have been a particular challenge for monetary policy.  Once the financial crises of late 1998 that followed the Russian default eased, efforts to address Y2K problems and growing optimism--if not euphoria--about profit opportunities produced a surge in investment, particularly in high-tech equipment and software.  The upswing outstripped what the nation could finance on a sustainable basis from domestic saving and funds attracted from abroad. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe shortfall of saving to finance investment showed through in a significant rise in average real long-term corporate interest rates starting in early 1999.  By June of that year, it was evident to the Federal Open Market Committee that to continue to hold the funds rate at the then-prevailing level of 4-3/4 percent in the face of rising real long-term corporate rates would have required a major infusion of liquidity into an economy already threatening to overheat. In fact, the increase in our target federal funds rate of 175 basis points through May of 2000 barely \\r\\nslowed the expansion of liquidity, judging from the M2 measure of the money supply, whose rate of increase declined only modestly through the tightening period. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy summer of last year, it started to become apparent that the growth of demand finally was slowing, and seemingly by enough to bring it into approximate alignment with the expansion of potential supply, as indicated by the fact that the pool of available labor was no longer being drawn down.  It was well into autumn, however, before one could be confident that the growth of aggregate demand had softened enough to bring it into a more lasting balance with potential supply.  Growth continued to decline to a point that by our December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided that the time to counter cumulative economic weakness was close at hand.  We altered our assessment of the risks to the economy, and with incoming information following the meeting continuing to be downbeat, we took our first easing action on January 3.  We viewed the faster downshift in economic activity, in part a consequence of the technology-enhanced speed and volume of information flows, as calling for a quicker pace of policy adjustment.  Acting on that view, we have lowered the federal funds rate 2-3/4 percentage points since the turn of the year, with last month's action leaving the federal funds rate at 3-3/4 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMost long-term interest rates, however, have barely budged despite the appreciable reductions in short-term rates since the beginning of the year.  This has led many commentators to ask whether inflation expectations have risen.  Surely, one reason long-term rates have held up is changed expectations in the Treasury market, as forecasts of the unified budget surplus were revised down, indicating that the supplies of outstanding marketable Treasury debt are unlikely to shrink as rapidly as previously anticipated.  Beyond that, it is difficult to judge whether long-term rates have held up because of firming inflation expectations or a belief that economic growth is likely to strengthen, spurring a rise in real long-term rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOne measure often useful in separating the real interest rates from inflation expectations is the spread between rates on nominal ten-year Treasury notes and inflation-indexed notes of similar maturity.  That spread rose more than three-fourths of a percentage point through the first five months of this year, a not insignificant change, though half of that increase has been reversed since.  By the nature of the indexed instrument, the spread between it and the comparable nominal rate reflects expected CPI inflation.  While actual CPI inflation has picked up this year, this rise has not been mirrored uniformly in other broad price measures.  For example, there has been little, if any, acceleration in the index of core personal consumption expenditure prices, which we consider to be a more reliable measure of inflation.  Moreover, survey readings on long term inflation expectations have remained quite stable. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by business people underscores the quiescence of inflationary pressures.  Businesses are experiencing the effects of softer demand in product markets overall, but these effects have been especially marked for many producers at earlier stages of processing, where prices generally have been flat to down thus far this year.  With energy prices now also moving lower and the lessening of tautness in labor markets expected to damp wage increases, overall prices seem likely to be contained in the period ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tForecasts of inflation, however, like all economic forecasts, do not have an enviable record.  Faced with such uncertainties, a central bank's vigilance against inflation is more than a monetary policy cliche; it is, of course, the way we fulfill our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable growth. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA central bank can contain inflation over time under most conditions.  But do we have the capability to eliminate booms and busts in economic activity?  Can fiscal and monetary \\r\\npolicy acting at their optimum eliminate the business cycle, as some of the more optimistic followers of J.M. Keynes seemed to believe several decades ago?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe answer, in my judgment, is no, because there is no tool to change human nature.  Too often people are prone to recurring bouts of optimism and pessimism that manifest themselves from time to time in the buildup or cessation of speculative excesses.  As I have noted in recent years, our only realistic response to a speculative bubble is to lean against the economic pressures that may accompany a rise in asset prices, bubble or not, and address forcefully the consequences of a sharp deflation of asset prices should they occur. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhile we are limited in our ability to anticipate and act on asset price bubbles, expectations about future economic developments nonetheless inevitably play a crucial role in our policymaking.  If we react only to past or current developments, lags in the effects of monetary policy could end up destabilizing the economy, as history has amply demonstrated. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause accurate point forecasts are extraordinarily difficult to fashion, we are forced also to consider the probability distribution of possible economic outcomes.  Against these distributions, we endeavor to judge the possible consequences of various alternative policy actions, especially the consequences of a policy mistake.  We recognize that this policy process may require substantial swings in the federal funds rate over time to help stabilize the economy, as, for example, recurring bouts of consumer and business optimism and pessimism drive economic activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn reducing the federal funds rate so substantially this year, we have been responding to our judgment that a good part of the recent weakening of demand was likely to persist for a while, and that there were significant downside risks even to a reduced central tendency forecast.  \\r\\nMoreover, with inflation low and likely to be contained, the main threat to satisfactory economic performance appeared to come from excessive weakness in activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a consequence of the policy actions of the FOMC, some of the stringent financial conditions evident late last year have been eased.  Real interest rates are down on a wide variety of borrowing instruments.  Private rates have benefited from some narrowing of risk premiums in many markets.  And the growth of liquidity, as measured by M2, has picked up.  More recently, incoming data on economic activity have turned from persistently negative to more mixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe period of sub-par economic performance, however, is not yet over, and we are not free of the risk that economic weakness will be greater than currently anticipated, and require further policy response.  That weakness could arise from softer demand abroad as well as from domestic developments.  But we need also to be aware that our front-loaded policy actions this year coupled with the tax cuts under way should be increasingly affecting economic activity as the year progresses. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe views of the Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents reflect this assessment. While recognizing the downside risks to their current forecast, most anticipate at least a slight strengthening of real activity later this year.  This is implied by the central tendency of their individual projections, which is for real GDP growth over all four quarters of 2001 of 1-1/4 to 2 percent.  Next year, the comparable figures are 3 to 3-1/4 percent.  The civilian unemployment rate is projected to rise further over the second half of the year, with a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent by the fourth quarter and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent four quarters later.  This easing of pressures in product and labor markets lies behind the central tendency for PCE price inflation of 2 to 2-1/2 percent over the four quarters of this year and 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent next year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs for the years beyond this horizon, there is still, in my judgment, ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations that has elevated the underlying growth in productivity to a rate significantly above that of the two decades preceding 1995.  By all evidence, we are not yet dealing with maturing technologies that, after having sparkled for a half-decade, are now in the process of fizzling out.  To the contrary, once the forces that are currently containing investment initiatives dissipate, new applications of innovative technologies should again strengthen demand for capital equipment and restore solid economic growth over time that benefits us all.\\r\\n\\nJuly 2001 Monetary policy report | 2001 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 24, 2001, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- February 17, 2000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report on the economy and monetary policy\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\r\\nFebruary 17, 2000\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking,\\r\\n Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 23, 2000\\n\\r\\n\\tI appreciate this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report on the economy and monetary policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThere is little evidence that the American economy, which grew more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably.  At the same time, inflation has remained largely contained.  An increase in the overall rate of inflation in 1999 was mainly a result of higher energy prices.  Importantly, unit labor costs actually declined in the second half of the year.  Indeed, still-preliminary data indicate that total unit cost increases last year remained extraordinarily low, even as the business expansion approached a record nine years.  Domestic operating profit margins, after sagging for eighteen months, apparently turned up again in the fourth quarter, and profit expectations for major corporations for the first quarter have been undergoing upward revisions since the beginning of the year--scarcely an indication of imminent economic weakness.\\r\\n\\nThe Economic Forces at Work\\n\\r\\n\\tUnderlying this performance, unprecedented in my half-century of observing the American economy, is a continuing acceleration in productivity.  Nonfarm business output per workhour increased 3-1/4 percent during the past year--likely more than 4 percent when measured by nonfarm business income.  Security analysts\\' projections of long-term earnings, an indicator of expectations of company productivity, continued to be revised upward in January, extending a string of upward revisions that began in early 1995.  One result of this remarkable economic performance has been a pronounced increase in living standards for the majority of Americans.  Another has been a labor market that has provided job opportunities for large numbers of people previously struggling to get on the first rung of a ladder leading to training, skills, and permanent employment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tYet those profoundly beneficial forces driving the American economy to competitive excellence are also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained, threaten our continuing prosperity.  Accelerating productivity entails a matching acceleration in the potential output of goods and services and a corresponding rise in real incomes available to purchase the new output.  The problem is that the pickup in productivity tends to create even greater increases in aggregate demand than in potential aggregate supply.  This occurs principally because a rise in structural productivity growth has its counterpart in higher expectations for long-term corporate earnings.  This, in turn, not only spurs business investment but also increases stock prices and the market value of assets held by households, creating additional purchasing power for which no additional goods or services have yet been produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tHistorical evidence suggests that perhaps three to four cents out of every additional dollar of stock market wealth eventually is reflected in increased consumer purchases.  The sharp rise in the amount of consumer outlays relative to disposable incomes in recent years, and the corresponding fall in the saving rate, has been consistent with this so-called wealth effect on household purchases.  Moreover, higher stock prices, by lowering the cost of equity capital, have helped to support the boom in capital spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOutlays prompted by capital gains in excess of increases in income, as best we can judge, have added about 1 percentage point to annual growth of gross domestic purchases, on average, over the past five years.  The additional growth in spending of recent years that has accompanied these wealth gains as well as other supporting influences on the economy appears to have been met in about equal measure from increased net imports and from goods and services produced by the net increase in newly hired workers over and above the normal growth of the work force, including a substantial net inflow of workers from abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut these safety valves that have been supplying goods and services to meet the recent increments to purchasing power largely generated by capital gains cannot be expected to absorb an excess of demand over supply indefinitely.  First, growing net imports and a widening current account deficit require ever larger portfolio and direct foreign investments in the United States, an outcome that cannot continue without limit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tImbalances in the labor markets perhaps may have even more serious implications for inflation pressures.  While the pool of officially unemployed and those otherwise willing to work may continue to shrink, as it has persistently over the past seven years, there is an effective limit to new hiring, unless immigration is uncapped.  At some point in the continuous reduction in the number of available workers willing to take jobs, short of the repeal of the law of supply and demand, wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity.  This would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs would be expected, imbalances between demand and potential supply in markets for goods and services are being mirrored in the financial markets by an excess in the demand for funds.  As a consequence, market interest rates are already moving in the direction of containing the excess of demand in financial markets and therefore in product markets as well.  For example, BBB corporate bond rates adjusted for inflation expectations have risen by more than 1 percentage point during the past two years.  However, to date, rising business earnings expectations and declining compensation for risk have more than offset the effects of this increase, propelling equity prices and the wealth effect higher.  Should this process continue, however, with the assistance of a monetary policy vigilant against emerging macroeconomic imbalances, real long-term rates will at some point be high enough to finally balance demand with supply at the economy\\'s potential in both the financial and product markets.  Other things equal, this condition will involve equity discount factors high enough to bring the rise in asset values into line with that of household incomes, thereby stemming the impetus to consumption relative to income that has come from rising wealth.  This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values--although that, of course, can happen at any time for any number of reasons--but rather that these values will increase no faster than household incomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause there are limits to the amount of goods and services that can be supplied from increasing net imports and by drawing on a limited pool of persons willing to work, it necessarily follows that consumption cannot keep rising faster than income.  Moreover, outsized increases in wealth cannot persist indefinitely either.  For so long as the levels of  consumption and investment are sensitive to asset values, equity values increasing at a pace faster than income, other things equal, will induce a rise in overall demand in excess of potential supply.  But that situation cannot persist without limit because the supply safety valves are themselves limited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith foreign economies strengthening and labor markets already tight, how the current wealth effect is finally contained will determine whether the extraordinary expansion that it has helped foster can slow to a sustainable pace, without destabilizing the economy in the process.\\r\\n\\nTechnological Change Continues Apace\\n\\r\\n\\tOn a broader front, there are few signs to date of slowing in the pace of innovation and the spread of our newer technologies that, as I have indicated in previous testimonies, have been at the root of our extraordinary productivity improvement.  Indeed, some analysts conjecture that we still may be in the earlier stages of the rapid adoption of new technologies and not yet in sight of the stage when this wave of innovation will crest.  With so few examples in our history, there is very little basis for determining the particular stage of development through which we are currently passing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWithout doubt, the synergies of the microprocessor, laser, fiber-optic glass, and satellite technologies have brought quantum advances in information availability.  These advances, in turn, have dramatically decreased business operational uncertainties and risk premiums and, thereby, have engendered major cost reductions and productivity advances.  There seems little question that further major advances lie ahead.  What is uncertain is the future pace of the application of these innovations, because it is this pace that governs the rate of change in productivity and economic potential.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMonetary policy, of course, did not produce the intellectual insights behind the technological advances that have been responsible for the recent phenomenal reshaping of our economic landscape.  It has, however, been instrumental, we trust, in establishing a stable financial and economic environment with low inflation that is conducive to the investments that have exploited these innovative technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFederal budget policy has also played a pivotal role.  The emergence of surpluses in the unified budget and of the associated increase in government saving over the past few years has been exceptionally important to the balance of the expansion, because the surpluses have been absorbing a portion of the potential excess of demand over sustainable supply associated partly with the wealth effect.  Moreover, because the surpluses are augmenting the pool of domestic saving, they have held interest rates below the levels that otherwise would have been needed to achieve financial and economic balance during this period of exceptional economic growth.  They have, in effect, helped to finance and sustain the productive private investment that has been key to capturing the benefits of the newer technologies that, in turn, have boosted the long-term growth potential of the U.S. economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe recent good news on the budget suggests that our longer-run prospects for continuing this beneficial process of recycling savings from the public to the private sectors have improved greatly in recent years.   Nonetheless, budget outlays are expected to come under mounting pressure as the baby boom generation moves into retirement, a process that gets under way a decade from now.  Maintaining the surpluses and using them to repay debt over coming years will continue to be an important way the federal government can encourage productivity-enhancing investment and rising standards of living.  Thus, we cannot afford to be lulled into letting down our guard on budgetary matters, an issue to which I shall return later in this testimony.\\r\\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\n\\r\\n\\tAlthough the outlook is clouded by a number of uncertainties, the central tendencies of the projections of the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents imply continued good economic performance in the United States.  Most of them expect economic growth to slow somewhat this year, easing into the 3-1/2 to  3-3/4 percent area.  The unemployment rate would remain in the neighborhood of 4 to 4-1/4 percent.  The rate of inflation for total personal consumption expenditures is expected to be 1-3/4 to 2 percent, at or a bit below the rate in 1999, which was elevated by rising energy prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn preparing these forecasts, the Federal Open Market Committee members had to consider several of the crucial demand- and supply-side forces I referred to earlier.  Continued favorable developments in labor productivity are anticipated both to raise the economy\\'s capacity to produce and, through its supporting effects on real incomes and asset values, to boost private domestic demand.  When productivity-driven wealth increases were spurring demand a few years ago, the effects on resource utilization and inflation pressures were offset in part by the effects of weakening foreign economies and a rising foreign exchange value of the dollar, which depressed exports and encouraged imports.  Last year, with the welcome recovery of foreign economies and with the leveling out of the dollar, these factors holding down demand and prices in the United States started to unwind.  Strong growth in foreign economic activity is expected to continue this year, and, other things equal, the effect of the previous appreciation of the dollar should wane, augmenting demand on U.S. resources and lessening one source of downward pressure on our prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a consequence, the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply may well depend on restraint on domestic demand, which continues to be buoyed by the lagged effects of increases in stock market valuations.  Accordingly, the appreciable increases in both nominal and real intermediate- and long-term interest rates over the last two years should act as a needed restraining influence in the period ahead.  However, to date, interest-sensitive spending has remained robust, and the FOMC will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity continue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAchieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depth of our various buffers against inflationary pressures.  Labor markets, for example, have tightened in recent years as demand has persistently outstripped even accelerating potential supply.  As I have previously noted, we cannot be sure in an environment with so little historical precedent what degree of labor market tautness could begin to push unit costs and prices up more rapidly.  We know, however, that there is a limit, and we can be sure that the smaller the pool of people without jobs willing to take them, the closer we are to that limit.  As the FOMC indicated after its last meeting, the risks still seem to be weighted on the side of building inflation pressures.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA central bank can best contribute to economic growth and rising standards of living by fostering a financial environment that promotes overall balance in the economy and price stability.  Maintaining an environment of effective price stability is essential, because the experience in the United States and abroad has underscored that low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for healthy, balanced, economic expansion.  Sustained expansion and price stability provide a backdrop against which workers and businesses can respond to signals from the marketplace in ways that make most efficient use of the evolving technologies.\\r\\n\\nFederal Budget Policy Issues\\n\\r\\n\\tBefore closing, I should like to revisit some issues of federal budget policy that I have addressed in previous congressional testimony.  Some modest erosion in fiscal discipline resulted last year through the use of the \"emergency\" spending initiatives and some \"creative accounting.\"  Although somewhat disappointing, that erosion was small relative to the influence of the wise choice of the Administration and the Congress to allow the bulk of the unified budget surpluses projected for the next several years to build and retire debt to the public.  The idea that we should stop borrowing from the social security trust fund to finance other outlays has gained surprising--and welcome--traction, and it establishes, in effect, a new budgetary framework that is centered on the on-budget surplus and how it should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis new framework is useful because it offers a clear objective that should strengthen budgetary discipline.  It moves the budget process closer to accrual accounting, the private-sector norm, and--I would hope--the ultimate objective of federal budget accounting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe new budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration generally look reasonable.  But, as many analysts have stressed, these estimates represent a midrange of possible outcomes for the economy and the budget, and actual budgetary results could deviate quite significantly from current expectations.  Some of the uncertainty centers on the likelihood that the recent spectacular growth of labor productivity will persist over the years ahead.  Like many private forecasters, the CBO and the Office of Management and Budget assume that productivity growth will drop back somewhat from the recent stepped-up pace.  But a distinct possibility, as I pointed out earlier, is that the development and diffusion of new technologies in the current wave of innovation may still be at a relatively early stage and that the scope for further acceleration of productivity is thus greater than is embodied in these budget projections.  If so, the outlook for budget surpluses would be even brighter than is now anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut there are significant downside risks to the budget outlook as well.  One is our limited knowledge of the forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years.  Of course, a good part of that surge is due to the extraordinary rise in the market value of assets which, as I noted earlier, cannot be sustained at the pace of recent years.  But that is not the entire story.  These relationships are complex, and until we have detailed tabulations compiled from actual tax returns, we shall not really know why individual tax revenues, relative to income, have been even higher than would have been predicted from rising asset values and bracket creep.  Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that this so-called \"tax surprise,\" which has figured so prominently in the improved budget picture of recent years, will dissipate or reverse.  If this were to happen, the projected surpluses, even with current economic assumptions, would shrink appreciably and perhaps disappear.  Such an outcome would be especially likely if adverse developments occurred in other parts of the budget as well--for example, if the recent slowdown in health care spending were to be followed by a sharper pickup than is assumed in current budget projections.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnother consideration that argues for letting the unified surpluses build is that the budget is still significantly short of balance when measured on an accrual basis.  If social security, for example, were measured on such a basis, counting benefits when they are earned by workers rather than when they are paid out, that program would have shown a substantial deficit last year.  The deficit would have been large enough to push the total federal budget into the red,  and an accrual-based budget measure could conceivably record noticeable deficits over the next few years, rather than the surpluses now indicated by the official projections for either the total unified budget or the on-budget accounts.  Such accruals take account of still growing contingent liabilities that, under most reasonable sets of actuarial assumptions, currently amount to many trillions of dollars for social security benefits alone. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEven if accrual accounting is set aside, it might still be prudent to eschew new longer-term, potentially irreversible commitments until we are assured that the on-budget surplus projections are less conjectural than they are, of necessity, today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAllowing surpluses to reduce the debt to the public, rather than for all practical purposes irrevocably committing to their disposition in advance, can be viewed as a holding action pending the clarification of the true underlying budget outcomes of the next few years.  Debt repaid can very readily be reborrowed to fund delayed initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMore fundamentally, the growth potential of our economy under current circumstances is best served, in my judgment, by allowing the unified budget surpluses presently in train to materialize and thereby reduce Treasury debt held by the public.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tYet I recognize that growing budget surpluses may be politically infeasible to defend.  If this proves to be the case, as I have also testified previously, the likelihood of maintaining a still satisfactory overall budget position over the longer run is greater, I believe, if surpluses are used to lower tax rates rather than to embark on new spending programs.  History illustrates the difficulties of keeping spending in check, especially in programs that are open-ended commitments, which too often have led to larger outlays than initially envisioned.  Decisions to reduce taxes, however, are more likely to be contained by the need to maintain an adequate revenue base to finance necessary government services.  Moreover, especially if designed to lower marginal rates, tax reductions can offer favorable incentives for economic performance.\\r\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\r\\n\\t As the U.S. economy enters a new century as well as a new year, the time is opportune to reflect on the basic characteristics of our economic system that have brought about our success in recent years.  Competitive and open markets, the rule of law, fiscal discipline, and a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship should continue to undergird rapid innovation and enhanced productivity that in turn should foster a sustained further rise in living standards.  It would be imprudent, however, to presume that the business cycle has been purged from market economies so long as human expectations are subject to bouts of euphoria and disillusionment.  We can only anticipate that we will readily take such diversions in stride and trust that beneficent fundamentals will provide the framework for continued economic progress well into the new millennium.\\r\\n\\n\\nFebruary 2000 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 2000 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: February 23, 2000, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\nFRB:  Testimony, Greenspan -- Monetary policy report to the Congress -- July 20, 2000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve's report on monetary policy\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate\\r\\nJuly 20, 2000\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 25, 2000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Chairman and other members of the Committee, I appreciate this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's report on monetary policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe Federal Reserve has been confronting a complex set of challenges in judging the stance of policy that will best contribute to sustaining the strong and long-running expansion of our economy.  The challenges will be no less in coming months as we judge whether ongoing adjustments in supply and demand will be sufficient to prevent distortions that would undermine the economy's extraordinary performance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor some time now, the growth of aggregate demand has exceeded the expansion of production potential.  Technological innovations have boosted the growth rate of potential, but as I noted in my testimony last February, the effects of this process also have spurred aggregate demand.  It has been clear to us that, with labor markets already quite tight, a continuing disparity between the growth of demand and potential supply would produce disruptive imbalances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA key element in this disparity has been the very rapid growth of consumption resulting from the effects on spending of the remarkable rise in household wealth.  However, the growth in household spending has slowed noticeably this spring from the unusually rapid pace observed late in 1999 and early this year.  Some argue that this slowing is a pause following the surge in demand through the warmer-than-normal winter months and hence a reacceleration can be expected later this year.  Certainly, we have seen slowdowns in spending during this near-decade-long expansion that have proven temporary, with aggregate demand growth subsequently rebounding to an unsustainable pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut other analysts point to a number of factors that may be exerting more persistent restraint on spending.  One they cite is the flattening in equity prices, on net, this year.  They attribute much of the slowing of consumer spending to this diminution of the wealth effect through the spring and early summer.  This view looks to equity markets as a key influence on the trend in consumer spending over the rest of this year and next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnother factor said by some to account for the spending slowdown is the rising debt burden of households.  Interest and amortization as a percent of disposable income have risen materially during the past six years, as consumer and especially mortgage debt has climbed and, more recently, as interest rates have moved higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, the past year's rise in the price of oil has amounted to an annual $75 billion levy by foreign producers on domestic consumers of imported oil, the equivalent of a tax of roughly 1 percent of disposable income.  This burden is another likely source of the slowed growth in real consumption outlays in recent months, though one that may prove to be largely transitory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMentioned less prominently have been the effects of the faster increase in the stock of consumer durable assets--both household durable goods and houses--in the last several years, a rate of increase that history tells us is usually followed by a pause.  Stocks of household durable goods, including motor vehicles, are estimated to have increased at nearly a 6 percent annual rate over the past three years, a marked acceleration from the growth rate of the previous ten years.  The number of cars and light trucks owned or leased by households, for example, apparently has continued to rise in recent years despite having reached nearly 1-3/4 vehicles per household by the mid-1990s.  Notwithstanding their recent slowing, sales of new homes continue at extraordinarily high levels relative to new household formations.  While we will not know for sure until the 2000 census is tabulated, the surge in new home sales is strong evidence that the growth of owner-occupied homes has accelerated during the past five years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThose who focus on the high and rising stocks of durable assets point out that even without the rise in interest rates, an eventual leveling out or some tapering off of purchases of durable goods and construction of single-family housing would be expected.  Reflecting both higher interest rates and higher stocks of housing, starts of new housing units have fallen off of late.  If that slowing were to persist, some reduction in the rapid pace of accumulation of household appliances across our more than hundred million households would not come as a surprise, nor would a slowdown in vehicle demand so often historically associated with declines in housing demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tInventories of durable assets in households are just as formidable a factor in new production as inventories at manufacturing and trade establishments.  The notion that consumer spending and housing construction may be slowing because the stock of consumer durables and houses may be running into upside resistance is a credible addition to the possible explanations of current consumer trends.  This effect on spending would be reinforced by the waning effects of gains in wealth. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause the softness in outlay growth is so recent, all of the aforementioned hypotheses, of course, must be provisional.  It is certainly premature to make a definitive assessment of either the recent trends in household spending or what they mean.  But it is clear that, for the time being at least, the increase in spending on consumer goods and houses has come down several notches, albeit from very high levels. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn one sense, the more important question for the longer-term economic outlook is the extent of any productivity slowdown that might accompany a more subdued pace of production and consumer spending, should it persist.  The behavior of productivity under such circumstances will be a revealing test of just how much of the rapid growth of productivity in recent years has represented structural change as distinct from cyclical aberrations and, hence, how truly different the developments of the past five years have been.  At issue is how much of the current downshift in our overall economic growth rate can be accounted for by reduced growth in output per hour and how much by slowed increases in hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSo far there is little evidence to undermine the notion that most of the productivity increase of recent years has been structural and that structural productivity may still be accelerating.  New orders for capital equipment continue quite strong--so strong that the rise in unfilled orders has actually steepened in recent months.  Capital-deepening investment in a broad range of equipment embodying the newer productivity-enhancing technologies remains brisk.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo be sure, if current personal consumption outlays slow significantly further than the pattern now in train suggests, profit and sales expectations might be scaled back, possibly inducing some hesitancy in moving forward even with capital projects that appear quite profitable over the longer run.  In addition, the direct negative effects of the sharp recent runup in energy prices on profits as well as on sales expectations may temporarily damp capital spending.  Despite the marked decline over the past decades in the energy requirements per dollar of GDP, energy inputs are still a significant element in the cost structure of many American businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor the moment, the dropoff in overall economic growth to date appears about matched by reduced growth in hours, suggesting continued strength in growth in output per hour.  The increase of production worker hours from March through June, for example, was at an annual rate of 1/2 percent compared with 3-1/4 percent the previous three months.  Of course, we do not have comprehensive measures of output on a monthly basis, but available data suggest a roughly comparable deceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA lower overall rate of economic growth that did not carry with it a significant deterioration in productivity growth obviously would be a desirable outcome.  It could conceivably slow or even bring to a halt the deterioration in the balance of overall demand and potential supply in our economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs I testified before this committee in February, domestic demand growth, influenced importantly by the wealth effect on consumer spending, has been running 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points at an annual rate in excess of even the higher, productivity-driven, growth in potential supply since late 1997.  That gap has been filled both by a marked rise in imports as a percent of GDP and by a marked increase in domestic production resulting both from significant immigration and from the employment of previously unutilized labor resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tI also pointed out in February that there are limits to how far net imports--or the broader measure, our current account deficit--can rise, or our pool of unemployed labor resources can fall.  As a consequence, the excess of the growth of domestic demand over potential supply must be closed before the resulting strains and imbalances undermine the economic expansion that now has reached 112 months, a record for peace or war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe current account deficit is a proxy for the increase in net claims against U.S. residents held by foreigners, mainly as debt, but increasingly as equities.  So long as foreigners continue to seek to hold ever-increasing quantities of dollar investments in their portfolios, as they obviously have been, the exchange rate for the dollar will remain firm.  Indeed, the same sharp rise in potential rates of return on new American investments that has been driving capital accumulation and accelerating productivity in the United States has also been inducing foreigners to expand their portfolios of American securities and direct investment.  The latest data published by the Department of Commerce indicate that the annual pace of direct plus portfolio investment by foreigners in the U.S. economy during the first quarter was more than two and one-half times its rate in 1995.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThere has to be a limit as to how much of the world's savings our residents can borrow at close to prevailing interest and exchange rates.  And a narrowing of disparities among global growth rates could induce a narrowing of rates of return here relative to those abroad that could adversely affect the propensity of foreigners to invest in the United States.  But obviously, so long as our rates of return appear to be unusually high, if not rising, balance of payments trends are less likely to pose a threat to our prosperity.  In addition, our burgeoning budget surpluses have clearly contributed to a fending off, if only temporarily, of some of the pressures on our balance of payments.  The stresses on the global savings pool resulting from the excess of domestic private investment demands over domestic private saving have been mitigated by the large federal budget surpluses that have developed of late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, by substantially augmenting national saving, these budget surpluses have kept real interest rates at levels lower than they would have been otherwise.  This development has helped foster the investment boom that in recent years has contributed greatly to the strengthening of U.S. productivity and economic growth.  The Congress and the Administration have wisely avoided steps that would materially reduce these budget surpluses.  Continued fiscal discipline will contribute to maintaining robust expansion of the American economy in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tJust as there is a limit to our reliance on foreign saving, so is there a limit to the continuing drain on our unused labor resources.  Despite the ever-tightening labor market, as yet, gains in compensation per hour are not significantly outstripping gains in productivity.  But as I have argued previously, should labor markets continue to tighten, short of a repeal of the law of supply and demand, labor costs eventually would have to accelerate to levels threatening price stability and our continuing economic expansion.\\r\\n\\tThe more modest pace of increase in domestic final spending in recent months suggests that aggregate demand may be moving closer into line with the rate of advance in the economy's potential, given our continued impressive productivity growth.  Should these trends toward supply and demand balance persist, the ongoing need for ever-rising imports and for a further draining of our limited labor resources should ease or perhaps even end.  Should this favorable outcome prevail, the immediate threat to our prosperity from growing imbalances in our economy would abate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut as I indicated earlier, it is much too soon to conclude that these concerns are behind us.  We cannot yet be sure that the slower expansion of domestic final demand, at a pace more in line with potential supply, will persist.  Even if the growth rates of demand and potential supply move into better balance, there is still uncertainty about whether the current level of labor resource utilization can be maintained without generating increased cost and price pressures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs I have already noted, to date costs have been held in check by productivity gains.  But at the same time, inflation has picked up--even the core measures that do not include energy prices directly.  Higher rates of core inflation may mostly reflect the indirect effects of energy prices, but the Federal Reserve will need to be alert to the risks that high levels of resource utilization may put upward pressure on inflation.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, energy prices may pose a challenge to containing inflation.  Energy price changes represent a one-time shift in a set of important prices, but by themselves generally cannot drive an ongoing inflation process.  The key to whether such a process could get under way is inflation expectations.  To date, survey evidence, as well as readings from the Treasury's inflation-indexed securities, suggests that households and investors do not view the current energy price surge as affecting longer-term inflation.  But any deterioration in such expectations would pose a risk to the economic outlook. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs the financing requirements for our ever-rising capital investment needs mounted in recent years--beyond forthcoming domestic saving--real long-term interest rates rose to address this gap.  We at the Federal Reserve, responding to the same economic forces, have moved the overnight federal funds rate up 1-3/4 percentage points over the past year.  To have held to the federal funds rate of June 1999 would have required a massive increase in liquidity that would presumably have underwritten an acceleration of prices and, hence, an eventual curbing of economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy our meeting this June, the appraisal of all the foregoing issues led the Federal Open Market Committee to conclude that, while some signs of slower growth were evident and justified standing pat at least for the time being, they were not sufficiently compelling to alter our view that the risks remained more on the side of higher inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs indicated in their forecasts, FOMC members and nonvoting presidents expect that the long period of continuous economic expansion will be extended over the next year and one-half, but with growth at a somewhat slower pace than over the past several years.  For the current year, the central tendency of Board members' and Reserve Bank presidents' forecasts is for real GDP to increase 4 to 4-1/2 percent, suggesting a noticeable deceleration over the second half of 2000 from its likely pace over the first half.  The unemployment rate is projected to remain close to 4 percent.  This outlook is a little stronger than anticipated last February, no doubt owing primarily to the unexpectedly strong jump in output in the first quarter.  Mainly reflecting higher prices of energy products than had been foreseen, the central tendency for inflation this year in prices for personal consumption expenditures also has been revised up somewhat, to the vicinity of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tGiven the firmer financial conditions that have developed over the past eighteen months, the Committee expects economic growth to moderate somewhat next year.  Real output is anticipated to expand 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent, somewhat less rapidly than in recent years.  The unemployment rate is likely to remain close to its recent very low levels.  Energy prices could ease somewhat, helping to trim PCE inflation next year to around 2 to 2-1/2 percent, somewhat above the average of recent years.\\r\\n\\nConclusion\\r\\n\\tThe last decade has been a remarkable period of expansion for our economy.  Federal Reserve policy through this period has been required to react to a constantly evolving set of economic forces, often at variance with historical relationships, changing federal funds rates when events appeared to threaten our prosperity, and refraining from action when that appeared warranted.  Early in the expansion, for example, we kept rates unusually low for an extended period, when financial sector fragility held back the economy.  Most recently we have needed to raise rates to relatively high levels in real terms in response to the side effects of accelerating growth and related demand-supply imbalances.  Variations in the stance of policy--or keeping it the same--in response to evolving forces are made in the framework of an unchanging objective--to foster as best we can those financial conditions most likely to promote sustained economic expansion at the highest rate possible.  Maximum sustainable growth, as history so amply demonstrates, requires price stability.  Irrespective of the complexities of economic change, our primary goal is to find those policies that best contribute to a noninflationary environment and hence to growth.  The Federal Reserve, I trust, will always remain vigilant in pursuit of that goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nJuly 2000 Monetary policy report | 2000 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 20, 2000, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- February 23, 1999\\nFRB: Humphrey-Hawkins Testimony - February 23, 1999\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report on monetary policy\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate\\r\\nFebruary 23, 1999\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services,\\r\\nU.S. House of Representatives, February 24, 1999\\n\\r\\n\\tMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report on monetary policy.\\n\\r\\n\\tThe U.S. economy over the past year again performed admirably.  Despite the challenges presented by severe economic downturns in a number of foreign countries and episodic financial turmoil abroad and at home, our real GDP grew about 4 percent for a third straight year.  In 1998, 2-3/4 million jobs were created on net, bringing the total increase in payrolls to more than 18 million during the current economic expansion, which late last year became the longest in U.S. peacetime history.  Unemployment edged down further to a 4-1/4 percent rate, the lowest since 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnd despite taut labor markets, inflation also fell to its lowest rate in many decades by some broad measures, although a portion of this decline owed to decreases in oil, commodity, and other import prices that are unlikely to be repeated.  Hourly labor compensation adjusted for inflation posted further impressive gains.  Real compensation gains have been supported by robust advances in labor productivity, which in turn have partly reflected heavy investment in plant and equipment, often embodying innovative technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCan this favorable performance be sustained?  In many respects the fundamental underpinnings of the recent U.S. economic performance are strong.  Flexible markets and the shift to surplus on the books of the federal government are facilitating the build-up in cutting-edge capital stock.  That build-up in turn is spawning rapid advances in productivity that are helping to keep inflation well behaved.  The new technologies and the optimism of consumers and investors are supporting asset prices and sustaining spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut, after eight years of economic expansion, the economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions, implying considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook.  The robust increase of production has been using up our nation\\'s spare labor resources, suggesting that recent strong growth in spending cannot continue without a pickup in inflation unless labor productivity growth increases significantly further.  Equity prices are high enough to raise questions about whether shares are overvalued.  The debt of the household and business sectors has mounted, as has the external debt of the country as a whole, reflecting the deepening current account deficit.  We remain vulnerable to rapidly changing conditions overseas, which, as we saw last summer, can be transmitted to U.S. markets quickly and traumatically.  I will be commenting on many of these issues as I review the developments of the past year and the prospects going forward.  In light of all these risks, monetary policy must be ready to move quickly in either direction should we perceive imbalances and distortions developing that could undermine the economic expansion.\\r\\n\\nRecent Developments\\r\\n\\tA hallmark of our economic performance over the past year was the continuing sharp expansion of business investment spending.  Competitive global markets and persisting technological advances both spurred the business drive to become more efficient and induced the price declines for many types of new equipment that made capital spending more attractive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBusiness success in enhancing productivity and the expectation of still further, perhaps accelerated, advances buoyed public optimism about profit prospects, which contributed to another sizable boost in equity prices.  Rising household wealth along with strong growth in real income, related to better pay, slower inflation, and expanding job opportunities, boosted consumption at the fastest clip in a decade and a half.  The gains in income and wealth last year, along with a further decrease in mortgage rates, also prompted considerable activity in the housing sector. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe impressive performance of the private sector was reflected in a continued improvement in the federal budget.  Burgeoning receipts, along with continuing restraint on federal spending, produced the first unified budget surplus in thirty years, allowing the Treasury to begin to pay down the federal debt held by the public.  This shift in the federal government\\'s fiscal position has fostered an increase in overall national saving as a share of GDP to 17-1/4 percent from the 14-1/2 percent low reached in 1993.  This rise in national saving has helped to hold down real interest rates and to facilitate the financing of the boom in private investment spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tForeign savers have provided an additional source of funds for vigorous domestic investment.  The counterpart of our high and rising current account deficit has been ever-faster increases in the net indebtedness of U.S. residents to foreigners.  The rapid widening of the current account deficit has some disquieting aspects, especially when viewed in a longer-term context.  Foreigners presumably will not want to raise indefinitely the share of their portfolios in claims on the United States.  Should the sustainability of the buildup of our foreign indebtedness come into question, the exchange value of the dollar may well decline, imparting pressures on prices in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn the recent economic environment, however, the widening of the trade and current account deficits had some beneficial aspects.  It provided a safety valve for strong U.S. domestic demand, thereby helping to restrain pressures on U.S. resources.  It also cushioned, to some extent, economic weakness in our trading partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t Moreover, decreasing import prices, which partly came from the appreciation of the dollar through mid-summer, contributed to low overall U.S. inflation, as did ample manufacturing capacity in the United States and lower prices for oil and other commodities stemming from the weak activity abroad.  The marked drop in energy prices significantly contributed to the subdued, less than 1 percent, increase in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures during 1998.  In addition, supported by rapid accumulation of more efficient capital, the growth of labor productivity picked up last year, allowing nominal labor compensation to post another sizable gain without putting added upward pressure on costs and prices.  I shall return to an analysis of the extraordinary performance of inflation later in my remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe Federal Open Market Committee conducted monetary policy last year with the aim of sustaining the remarkable combination of economic expansion and low inflation.  At its meetings from March to July, the inflation risks accompanying the continued strength of domestic demand and the tightening of labor markets necessitated that the FOMC place itself on heightened inflation alert.  Although the FOMC kept the nominal federal funds rate unchanged, it allowed the real funds rate to rise with continuing declines in inflation and, presumably, inflation expectations.  In August, the FOMC returned to an unbiased policy predilection in response to the adverse implications for the U.S. outlook of worsening conditions in foreign economies and in global financial markets, including our own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tShortly thereafter, a further deterioration in financial market conditions began to pose a more serious threat to economic stability.  In the wake of the Russian crisis and subsequent difficulties in other emerging-market economies, investors perceived that the uncertainties in financial markets had broadened appreciably and as a consequence they became decidedly more risk averse.  Safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasury securities intensified at the expense of private debt securities.  As a result, quality spreads escalated dramatically, especially for lower-rated issuers.  Many financial markets turned illiquid, with wider bid-asked spreads and heightened price volatility, and issuance was disrupted in some private securities markets.  Even the liquidity in the market for seasoned issues of U.S. Treasury securities dried up, as investors shifted toward the more actively traded, recently issued securities and dealers pared inventories, fearing that heightened price volatility posed an unacceptable risk to their capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tResponding to losses in foreign financial markets and to pressures from counterparties, highly leveraged investors began to unwind their positions, which further weighed on market conditions.  As credit became less available to business borrowers in capital markets, their demands were redirected to commercial banks, which reacted to the enlarged borrowing, and more uncertain business prospects, by tightening their standards and terms on such lending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo cushion the domestic economy from the impact of the increasing weakness in foreign economies and the less accommodative conditions in U.S. financial markets, the FOMC, beginning in late September, undertook three policy easings.  By mid-November, the FOMC had reduced the federal funds rate from 5-1/2 percent to 4-3/4 percent.  These actions were taken to rebalance the risks to the outlook, and, in the event, the markets have recovered appreciably.  Our economy has weathered the disturbances with remarkable resilience, though some yield and bid-asked spreads still reflect a hesitancy on the part of market participants to take on risk.  The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains appropriate as those disturbances abate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo date, domestic demand and hence employment and output have remained vigorous.  Real GDP is estimated to have risen at an annual rate exceeding 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  Although some slowing from this torrid pace is most likely in the first quarter, labor markets remain exceptionally tight and the economy evidently retains a great deal of underlying momentum despite the global economic problems and the still-visible remnants of the earlier financial turmoil in the United States.  At the same time, no evidence of any upturn in inflation has, as yet, surfaced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAbroad, the situation is mixed.  In some East Asian countries that, in recent years, experienced a loss of investor confidence, a severe currency depreciation, and a deep recession, early signs of stabilization and economic recovery have appeared.  This is particularly the case for Korea and Thailand.  Authorities in those countries, in the context of IMF stabilization programs, early on established appropriate macroeconomic policies and undertook significant structural reforms to buttress the banking system and repair the finances of the corporate sector.  As investor confidence has returned, exchange rates have risen and interest rates have fallen.  With persistence and follow-through on reforms, the future of those economies has promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe situations in some other emerging market economies are not as encouraging.  The Russian government\\'s decision in mid-August to suspend payments on its domestic debt and devalue the ruble took markets by surprise.  Investor flight exacerbated the collapse of prices in Russian financial markets and led to a sharp depreciation of the ruble.  The earlier decline in output gathered momentum, and by late in the year inflation had moved up to a triple-digit annual rate.  Russia\\'s stabilization program with the IMF has been on hold since the financial crisis hit, and the economic outlook there remains troubling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe Russian financial crisis immediately spilled over to some other countries, hitting Latin America especially hard.  Countering downward pressure on the exchange values of the affected currencies, interest rates moved sharply higher, especially in Brazil.  As a consequence of the high interest rates and growing economic uncertainty, Brazil\\'s economic activity took a turn for the worse.  Higher interest rates also had negative consequences for the fiscal outlook, as much of Brazil\\'s substantial domestic debt effectively carries floating interest rates.  With budget reform legislation encountering various setbacks, market confidence waned further and capital outflows from Brazil continued, drawing down foreign currency reserves.  Ultimately, the decision was taken to allow the real to float, and it subsequently depreciated sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBrazilian authorities must walk a very narrow, difficult path of restoring confidence and keeping inflation contained with monetary policy while dealing with serious fiscal imbalances.  Although the situation in Brazil remains uncertain, there has been limited contagion to other countries thus far.  Apparently, the slow onset of the crisis has enabled many parties with Brazilian exposures to hedge those positions or allow them to run off.  With the net exposure smaller, and increasingly held by those who both recognized the heightened risk and were willing to bear it, some of the elements that might have contributed to further contagion may have been significantly reduced.\\r\\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\r\\n\\tThese recent domestic and international developments provide the backdrop for U.S. economic prospects.  Our economy\\'s performance should remain solid this year, though likely with a slower pace of economic expansion and a slightly higher rate of overall inflation than last year.  The stocks of business equipment, housing, and household durable goods have been growing rapidly to quite high levels relative to business sales or household incomes during the past few years, and some slowing in the growth of spending on these items seems a reasonable prospect.  Moreover, part of the rapid increase in spending, especially in the household sector, has resulted from the surge in wealth associated with a run-up in equity prices that is unlikely to be repeated.  And the purchasing power of income and wealth has been enhanced by declines in oil and other import prices, which also are unlikely to recur this year.  Assuming that aggregate demand decelerates, underlying inflation pressures, as captured by core price measures, in all likelihood will not intensify significantly in the year ahead, though the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments carefully.  We perceive stable prices as optimum for economic growth.  Both inflation and deflation raise volatility and risks that thwart maximum economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMost Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents foresee that economic growth this year will slow to a 2-1/2 to 3 percent rate.  Such growth would keep the unemployment rate about unchanged.  The central tendency of the Governors\\' and Presidents\\' predictions of CPI inflation is 2 to 2-1/2 percent.  This level represents a pickup from last year, when energy prices were falling, but it is in the vicinity of core CPI inflation over the last couple of years. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis outlook involves several risks.  The continuing downside risk posed by possible economic and financial instability around the world was highlighted earlier this year by the events in Brazil.  Although financial contagion elsewhere has been limited to date, more significant knock-on effects in financial markets and in the economies of Brazil\\'s important trading partners, including the United States, are still possible.  Moreover, the economies of several of our key industrial trading partners have shown evidence of weakness, which if it deepens could further depress demands for our exports.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnother downside risk is that growth in capital spending, especially among manufacturers, could weaken appreciably if pressures on domestic profit margins mount and capacity utilization drops further.  And it remains to be seen whether corporate earnings will disappoint investors, even if the slowing of economic growth is only moderate.  Investors appear to have incorporated into current equity price levels both robust profit expectations and low compensation for risk.  As the economy slows to a more sustainable pace as expected, profit forecasts could be pared back, which together with a greater sense of vulnerability in business prospects could damp appetites for equities.  A downward correction to stock prices, and an associated increase in the cost of equity capital, could compound a slowdown in the growth of capital spending.  In addition, a stock market decline would tend to restrain consumption spending through its effect on household net worth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut on the upside, our economy has proved surprisingly robust in recent years.  More rapid increases in capital spending, productivity, real wages, and asset prices have combined to boost economic growth far more and far longer than many of us would have anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis \"virtuous cycle\" has been able to persist because the behavior of inflation also has been surprisingly favorable, remaining well contained at levels of utilization of labor that in the past would have produced accelerating prices.  That it has not done so in recent years has been the result of a combination of special one-time factors holding down prices and more lasting changes in the processes determining inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAmong the temporary factors, the sizable declines in the prices of oil, other internationally traded commodities, and other imports contributed directly to holding down inflation last year, and also indirectly by reducing inflation expectations.  But these prices are not likely to fall further, and they could begin to rise as some Asian economies revive and the effects of the net depreciation of the dollar since mid-summer are felt more strongly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAt the same time, however, recent experience does seem to suggest that the economy has become less inflation prone than in the past, so that the chances of an inflationary breakout arguably are, at least for now, less than they would have been under similar conditions in earlier cycles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSeveral years ago I suggested that worker insecurity might be an important reason for unusually damped inflation.  From the early 1990s through 1996, survey results indicated that workers were becoming much more concerned about being laid off.  Workers\\' underlying fear of technology-driven job obsolescence, and hence willingness to stress job security over wage increases, appeared to have suppressed labor cost pressures despite a reduced unemployment rate.  More recently, that effect seems to have diminished in part.  So while job loss fears probably contributed to wage and price suppression through 1996, it does not appear that a further heightening of worker insecurity about employment prospects can explain the more recent improved behavior of inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tInstead, a variety of evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, suggests that the source of recent restrained inflation may be emanating more from employers than from employees.  In the current economic setting, businesses sense that they have lost pricing power and generally have been unwilling to raise wages any faster than they can support at current price levels.  Firms have evidently concluded that if they try to increase their prices, their competitors will not follow, and they will lose market share and profits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tGiven the loss of pricing power, it is not surprising that individual employers resist pay increases.  But why has pricing power of late been so delimited?  Monetary policy certainly has played a role in constraining the rise in the general level of prices and damping inflation expectations over the 1980s and 1990s.  But our current discretionary monetary policy has difficulty anchoring the price level over time in the same way that the gold standard did in the last century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEnhanced opportunities for productive capital investment to hold down costs also may have helped to damp inflation.  Through the 1970s and 1980s, firms apparently found it easier and more profitable to seek relief from rising nominal labor costs through price increases than through cost-reducing capital investments.  Price relief evidently has not been available in recent years.  But relief from cost pressures has.  The newer technologies have made capital investment distinctly more profitable, enabling firms to substitute capital for labor far more productively than they would have a decade or two ago. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tStarting in 1993, capital investment, especially in high-tech equipment, rose sharply beyond normal cyclical experience, apparently the result of expected increases in rates of return on the new investment.  Had the profit expectations not been realized, one would have anticipated outlays to fall back.  Instead, their growth accelerated through the remainder of the decade. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMore direct evidence confirms improved underlying profitability.  According to rough estimates, labor and capital productivity has risen significantly during the past five years.  It seems likely that the synergies of advances in laser, fiber optic, satellite, and computer technologies with older technologies have enlarged the pool of opportunities to achieve a rate of return above the cost of capital.  Moreover, the newer technologies have facilitated a dramatic foreshortening of the lead times on the delivery of capital equipment over the past decade, presumably allowing businesses to react more expeditiously to an actual or expected rise in nominal compensation costs than, say, they could have in the 1980s.  In addition, the surge in investment not only has restrained costs, it has also increased industrial capacity faster than factory output has risen.  The resulting slack in product markets has put greater competitive pressure on businesses to hold down prices, despite taut labor markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\tThe role of technology in damping inflation is manifest not only in its effects on U.S. productivity and costs, but also through international trade, where technological developments have progressively broken down barriers to cross-border trade.  The enhanced competition in tradable goods has enabled excess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment worldwide supply and exert restraint on prices in all countries\\' markets.  The resulting price discipline also has constrained nominal wage gains in internationally tradable goods industries.  As workers have attempted to shift to other sectors, gains in nominal wages and increases in prices in nontradeable goods industries have been held down as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe process of price containment has potentially become, to some extent, self-reinforcing.  Lower inflation in recent years has altered expectations.  Workers no longer believe that escalating gains in nominal wages are needed to reap respectable increases in real wages, and their remaining sense of job insecurity is reinforcing this.  Since neither firms nor their competitors can count any longer on a general inflationary tendency to validate decisions to raise their own prices, each company feels compelled to concentrate on efforts to hold down costs.  The availability of new technology to each company and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps to boost productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIt is difficult to judge whether these significant shifts in the market environment in which firms function are sufficient to account for our benign overall price behavior during the past half decade.  Undoubtedly, other factors have been at work as well, including those temporary factors I mentioned earlier and some more lasting I have not discussed, such as worldwide deregulation and privatization, and the freeing up of resources previously employed to produce military products that was brought about by the end of the cold war.  There also may be other contributory forces lurking unseen in the wings that will only become clear in time.  Over the longer run, of course, the actions of the central bank determine the degree of overall liquidity and hence rate of inflation.  It is up to us to validate the favorable inflation developments of recent years.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAlthough the pace of productivity increase has picked up in recent years, the extraordinary strength of demand has meant that the substitution of capital for labor has not prevented us from rapidly depleting the pool of available workers.  This worker depletion constitutes a critical upside risk to the inflation outlook because it presumably cannot continue for very much longer without putting increasing pressure on labor markets and on costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe number of people willing to work can be usefully defined as the unemployed component of the labor force plus those not actively seeking work, and thus not counted in the labor force, but who nonetheless say they would like a job if they could get one.  This pool of potential workers aged 16 to 64 currently numbers about 10 million, or just 5-3/4 percent of that group\\'s population--the lowest such percentage on record, which begins in 1970, and 2-1/2 percentage points below its average over that period.  The rapid increase in aggregate demand has generated growth of employment in excess of growth in population, causing the number of potential workers to fall since the mid-1990s at a rate of a bit under 1 million annually.  We cannot judge with precision how much further this level can decline without sparking ever greater upward pressures on wages and prices.  But, should labor market conditions continue to tighten, there has to be some point at which the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will begin to accelerate.\\r\\n\\nRanges for Money and Credit\\r\\n  \\tAt its February meeting, the Committee elected to ratify the provisional ranges for all three aggregates that it had established last July.  Specifically, the Committee again has set growth rate ranges over the four quarters of 1999 of 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt.  As in previous years, the Committee interpreted the ranges for the broader monetary aggregates as benchmarks for what money growth would be under conditions of price stability and sustainable economic growth, assuming historically typical velocity behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLast year, these monetary aggregates far overshot the upper bounds of their annual ranges.  While nominal GDP growth did exceed the rate likely consistent with sustained price stability, the rapid growth of M2 and M3 also reflected outsized declines in their velocities, that is, the ratio of nominal GDP to money.  M2 velocity dropped by about 3 percent, while M3 velocity plunged by 5-1/4 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tPart of these velocity declines reflected some reduction in the opportunity cost of holding money; interest rates on Treasury securities, which represent an alternative return on non-monetary assets, dropped more than did the average of interest rates on deposits and money market mutual funds in M2, drawing funds into the aggregate.  Even so, much of last year\\'s aberrant behavior of broad money velocity cannot readily be explained by conventional determinants.  Although growth of the broad aggregates was strong earlier in the year, it accelerated in the fourth quarter after credit markets became turbulent.  Perhaps robust money growth late in the year partly reflected a reaction to this turmoil by the public, who began scrambling for safer and more liquid financial assets.  Monetary expansion has moderated so far this year, evidently in lagged response to the calming of financial markets in the autumn.  Layered on top of these influences, though, the public also may have been reapportioning their savings flows into money balances because the huge run-up in stock prices in recent years has resulted in an uncomfortable portion of their net worth in equity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor the coming year, the broad monetary aggregates could again run high relative to these ranges.  To be sure, the decline in the velocities of the broader aggregates this year should abate to some extent, as money demand behavior returns more to normal, and growth in nominal GDP should slow as well, as suggested by the Governors\\' and Presidents\\' central tendency.  Both factors would restrain broad money expansion relative to last year.  Still, the growth of M2 and M3 could well remain outside their price-stability ranges this year.  Obviously, considerable uncertainty continues to surround the prospective behavior of monetary velocities and growth rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tDomestic nonfinancial debt seems more likely than the monetary aggregates to grow within its range for this year.  Indeed, domestic nonfinancial debt also could grow more slowly this year than last year\\'s 6-1/4 percent pace, which was in the upper part of its 3 to 7 percent annual range.  With the federal budget surplus poised to widen further this year, federal debt should contract even more quickly than last year.  And debt in each of the major nonfederal sectors in all likelihood will decelerate as well from last year\\'s relatively elevated rates, along with the projected slowing of nominal GDP growth.\\r\\n\\nThe FOMC\\'s Disclosure Policy\\r\\n\\tThe FOMC at recent meetings has discussed not only the stance of policy, but also when and how it communicates its views of the evolving economic situation to the public.  The FOMC\\'s objective is to release as much information about monetary policy decision making, and as promptly, as is consistent with maintaining an effective deliberative process and avoiding roiling markets unnecessarily.  Since early 1994, each change in the target nominal federal funds rate has been announced immediately with a brief rationale for the action.  The FOMC resolved at its December meeting to take advantage of an available, but unused policy, originally stated in early 1995, of releasing, on an infrequent basis, a statement immediately after some FOMC meetings at which the stance of monetary policy has not been changed.  The Federal Reserve will release such a statement when it wishes to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy.  Such an announcement need not be made after every change in the tilt of the directive.  Instead, this option would be reserved for situations in which the consensus of the Committee clearly had shifted significantly, though not by enough to change current policy, and in which the absence of an explanation risked misleading markets about the prospects for monetary policy.\\r\\n\\nYear 2000 Issues\\r\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to address an issue that has been receiving increasing attention--the century date change.  While no one can say that the rollover to the year 2000 will be trouble free, I am impressed by the efforts to date to address the problem in the banking and financial system.  For our part, the Federal Reserve System has now completed remediation and testing of 101 of its 103 mission-critical applications, with the remaining two to be replaced by the end of March.  We opened a test facility in June at which more than 6000 depository institutions to date have conducted tests of their Y2K compliant systems, and we are well along in our risk mitigation and contingency planning activities.  As a precautionary measure, the Federal Reserve has acted to increase the currency in inventory by about one-third to approximately $200 billion in late 1999 and has other contingency arrangements available if needed.  While we do not expect currency demand to increase dramatically, the Federal Reserve believes it is important for the public to have confidence in the availability of cash in advance of the rollover.  As a result of these kinds of activities, I can say with assurance that the Federal Reserve will be ready in both its operations and planning activities for the millennium rollover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe banking industry is also working hard, and with evident success, to prepare for the event.  By the end of the first quarter, every institution in the industry will have been subject to two rounds of on-site Y2K examinations.  The Federal Reserve, like the other regulators, has found that only a small minority of institutions has fallen behind in their preparations, and those institutions have been targeted for additional follow-up and, as necessary, formal enforcement actions.  The overwhelming majority of the industry has made impressive progress in their remediation, testing, and contingency planning efforts.\\r\\n\\nConcluding Comment\\r\\n\\tAmericans can justifiably feel proud of their recent economic achievements.  Competitive markets, with open trade both domestically and internationally, have kept our production efficient and on the expanding frontier of technological innovation.  The determination of Americans to improve their skills and knowledge has allowed workers to be even more productive, elevating their real earnings.  Macroeconomic policies have provided a favorable setting for the public to take greatest advantage of opportunities to improve its economic well being.  The restrained fiscal policy of the Administration and the Congress has engendered the welcome advent of a unified budget surplus, freeing up funds for capital investment.  A continuation of responsible fiscal and, we trust, monetary policies should afford Americans the opportunity to make considerable further economic progress over time.        \\r\\n\\r\\n\\nFebruary 1999 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 1999 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: February 24, 1999, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- July 22, 1999\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve's semiannual report on monetary policy\\nBefore the Committee on Banking and\\r\\n Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\r\\nJuly 22, 1999\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on July 28, 1999 \\n\\r\\nThank you, Mr. Chairman and other members of the Committee, for this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual report on monetary policy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, 1999 has been an exceptional year for the American economy, but a challenging one for American monetary policy.  Through the first six months of this year, the U.S. economy has further extended its remarkable performance:  Almost 1-1/4 million jobs were added to payrolls on net, and gross domestic product apparently expanded at a brisk pace, perhaps near that of the prior three years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the root of this impressive expansion of economic activity has been a marked acceleration in the productivity of our nation's workforce.  This productivity growth has allowed further healthy advances in real wages and has permitted activity to expand at a robust clip while helping to foster price stability.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast fall, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased monetary policy to counter a seizing-up of financial markets that threatened to disrupt economic activity significantly.  As those markets recovered, the FOMC had to assess whether that policy stance remained appropriate.  By late last month, when it became apparent that much of the financial strain of last fall had eased, that foreign economies were firming, and that demand in the United States was growing at an unsustainable pace, the FOMC raised its intended federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to 5 percent.  To have refrained from doing so in our judgment would have put the U.S. economy's expansion at risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf nothing else, the experience of the last decade has reinforced earlier evidence that a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth is price stability.  While product prices have remained remarkably restrained in the face of exceptionally strong demand and expanding potential supply, it is imperative that we do not become complacent.\\r\\n \\r\\n The already shrunken pool of job-seekers and considerable strength of aggregate demand suggest that the Federal Reserve will need to be especially alert to inflation risks.  Should productivity fail to continue to accelerate and demand growth persist or strengthen, the economy could overheat.  That would engender inflationary pressures and put the sustainability of this unprecedented period of remarkable growth in jeopardy.  One indication that inflation risks were rising would be a tendency for labor markets to tighten further.  But the FOMC also needs to continue to assess whether the existing degree of pressure in these markets is consistent with sustaining our low-inflation environment.  If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude imbalances from arising that would only require a more disruptive adjustment later--one that could impair the expansion and bring into question whether the many gains already made can be sustained.\\r\\n\\nRecent Developments \\r\\nA number of important forces have been shaping recent developments in the U.S. economy.  One has been a recovery of financial markets from the disruptions of last fall.  By the end of 1998, the extreme withdrawal from risk-taking and consequent seizing-up of markets had largely dissipated.  This year, risk spreads have narrowed further--though generally not to the unrealistically low levels of a year ago--and a heavy volume of issuance in credit markets has signaled a return to their more-normal functioning.  Equity prices have risen to new highs and, in the process, have elevated price-earnings ratios to historic levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n Abroad, many financial markets and economies also have improved.  Brazil weathered a depreciation of its currency with limited fallout on its neighbors.  In Asia, a number of the emerging market economies seemed to be reviving after the trying adjustments of the previous year or so.  Progress has not been universal, and in many economies prospects remain clouded, depending importantly on the persistence of efforts to make fundamental reforms whose necessity had been made so painfully obvious in the crises those economies endured.   Nonetheless, the risks of further major disruptions to financial and trade flows that had concerned the FOMC when it eased policy last fall have clearly diminished.  Improving global prospects also mean that the U.S. economy will no longer be experiencing declines in basic commodity and import prices that held down inflation in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the domestic economy, data becoming available this year have tended to confirm that productivity growth has stepped up.  It is this acceleration of productivity over recent years that has explained much of the surprising combination of a slowing in inflation and sustained rapid real growth.  Increased labor productivity has directly limited the rise of unit labor costs and accordingly damped pressures on prices.  This good inflation performance, reinforced also by falling import prices, in turn has fostered further declines in inflation expectations over recent years that bode well for pressures on costs and prices going forward.  \\r\\n \\r\\n In testimony before this committee several years ago, I raised the possibility that we were entering a period of technological innovation that occurs perhaps once every fifty or one-hundred years.  The evidence then was only marginal and inconclusive.  Of course, tremendous advances in computing and telecommunications were apparent, but their translations into improved overall economic efficiency and rising national productivity were conjectural at best.  While the growth of output per hour had shown some signs of quickening, the normal variations exhibited by such data in the past were quite large.  More intriguing was the remarkable surge in capital investment after 1993, especially in high-tech goods, a full two years after a general recovery was under way.  This suggested a marked increase in the perceived prospective rates of return on the newer technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat American productivity growth has picked up over the past five years or so has become increasingly evident.  Nonfarm business productivity (on a methodologically consistent basis) grew at an average rate of a bit over 1 percent per year in the 1980s.  In recent years, productivity growth has picked up to more than 2 percent, with the past year averaging about 2-1/2 percent.\\r\\n \\r\\n To gauge the potential for similar, if not larger, gains in productivity going forward, we need to attempt to arrive at some understanding of what has occurred to date.  A good deal of the acceleration in output per hour has reflected the sizable increase in the stock of labor-saving equipment.  But that is not the whole story.  Output has grown beyond what normally would have been expected from increased inputs of labor and capital alone.  Business restructuring and the synergies of the new technologies have enhanced productive efficiencies.  American industry quite generally has shared an improved level of efficiency and cost containment through high-tech capital investment, not solely newer industries at the cutting edge of innovation.  Our century-old motor vehicle industry, for example, has raised output per hour by a dramatic 4-1/2 percent annually on average in the past two years, compared with a lackluster 1-1/4 percent on average earlier this decade.  Much the same is true of many other mature industries, such as steel, textiles, and other stalwarts of an earlier age.  This has confirmed the earlier indications of an underlying improvement in rates of return on the newer technologies and their profitable synergies with the existing capital stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese developments have created a broad range of potential innovations that have granted firms greater ability to profitably displace costly factors of production whenever profit margins have been threatened.  Moreover, the accelerating use of newer technologies has markedly enhanced the flexibility of our productive facilities.  It has dramatically reduced the lead times on the acquisition of new equipment and enabled firms to adjust quickly to changing market demands.  This has indirectly increased productive capacity and effectively, at least for now, eliminated production bottlenecks and the shortages and price pressures they inevitably breed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis greater ability to pare costs, increase production flexibility, and expand capacity are arguably the major reasons why inflationary pressures have been held in check in recent years.  Others have included the one-time fall in the prices of oil, other commodities, and imports more generally.  In addition, a breaking down of barriers to cross-border trade, owing both to the new technologies and to the reduction of government restrictions on trade, has intensified the pressures of competition, helping to contain prices.  Coupled with the decline in military spending worldwide, this has freed up resources for more productive endeavors, especially in a number of previously nonmarket economies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore generally, the consequent erosion of pricing power has imparted an important imperative to hold down costs.  The availability of new technology to each company and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps to reduce costs, which translates on a consolidated basis into increased national productivity.\\r\\n \\r\\n The acceleration in productivity owes importantly to new information technologies.  Prior to this IT revolution, most of twentieth-century business decisionmaking had been hampered by limited information.  Owing to the paucity of timely knowledge of customers' needs, the location of inventories, and the status of material flows throughout complex production systems, businesses built in substantial redundancies.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoubling up on materials and staffing was essential as a cushion against the inevitable misjudgments made in real time when decisions were based on information that was hours, days, or even weeks old.  While businesspeople must still operate in an uncertain world, the recent years' remarkable surge in the availability of real-time information has enabled them to remove large swaths of inventory safety stocks, redundant capital equipment, and layers of workers, while arming them with detailed data to fine-tune specifications to most individual customer needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the remarkable progress witnessed to date, history counsels us to be quite modest about our ability to project the future path and pace of technology and its implications for productivity and economic growth.  We must remember that the pickup in productivity is relatively recent, and a key question is whether that growth will persist at a high rate, drop back toward the slower standard of much of the last twenty-five years, or climb even more.  By the last I do not just mean that productivity will continue to grow, but that it will grow at an increasingly faster pace through a continuation of the process that has so successfully contained inflation and supported economic growth in recent years.\\r\\n \\r\\n The business and financial community does not as yet appear to sense a pending flattening in this process of increasing productivity growth.  This is certainly the widespread impression imparted by corporate executives.  And it is further evidenced by the earnings forecasts of more than a thousand securities analysts who regularly follow S&P 500 companies on a firm-by-firm basis, which presumably embody what corporate executives are telling them.  While the level of these estimates is no doubt upwardly biased, unless these biases have significantly changed over time, the revisions of these estimates should be suggestive of changes in underlying economic forces.  Except for a short hiatus in the latter part of 1998, analysts' expectations of five-year earnings growth have been revised up continually since early 1995.  If anything, the pace of those upward revisions has quickened of late.  True, some of that may reflect a pickup in expected earnings of foreign affiliates, especially in Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia.  But most of this year's increase almost surely owes to domestic influences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are only a limited number of ways that the expected long-term growth of domestic profits can increase, and some we can reasonably rule out.  There is little evidence that company executives or security analysts have significantly changed their views in recent months of the longer-term outlook for continued price containment, the share of profits relative to wages, or anticipated growth of hours worked.  Rather, analysts and the company executives they talk to appear to be expecting that unit costs will be held in check, or even lowered, as sales expand.  Hence, implicit in upward revisions of their forecasts, when consolidated, is higher expected national productivity growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent data on costs and prices in recent years tend to confirm what aggregate data on output and hours worked indicate:  that productivity growth has risen.  With price inflation stable and domestic operating profit margins rising, the rate of increase in total consolidated unit costs must have been falling.\\r\\n \\r\\n Even taking into account the evidence of declining unit interest costs of nonfinancial corporations, unit labor cost increases (which constitute three quarters of total unit costs) must also be slowing.  Because until very recently growth of compensation per hour has been rising, albeit modestly, it follows that productivity growth must have been rising these past five years, as well.  Accelerating productivity is thus evident in underlying consolidated income statements of nonfinancial corporations, as well as in our more direct, though doubtless partly flawed, measures of output and input.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, we must also understand the limits to this process of productivity-driven growth.  To be sure, the recent acceleration in productivity has provided an offset to our taut labor markets by holding unit costs in check and by adding to the competitive pressures that have contained prices.  But once output-per-hour growth stabilizes, even if at a higher rate, any pickup in the growth of nominal compensation per hour will translate directly into a more-rapid rate of increase in unit labor costs, heightening the pressure on firms to raise the prices of the goods and services they sell.  Thus, should the increments of gains in technology that have fostered productivity slow, any extant pressures in the labor market should ultimately show through to product prices.\\r\\n \\r\\n Meanwhile, though, the impressive productivity growth of recent years also has had important implications for the growth of aggregate demand.  If productivity is driving up real incomes and profits--and, hence, gross domestic income--then gross domestic product must mirror this rise with some combination of higher sales of motor vehicles, other consumer goods, new homes, capital equipment, and net exports.  By themselves, surges in economic growth are not necessarily unsustainable--provided they do not exceed the sum of the rate of growth in the labor force and productivity for a protracted period.  However, when productivity is accelerating, it is very difficult to gauge when an economy is in the process of overheating.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such circumstances, assessing conditions in the labor market can be helpful in forming those judgments.  Employment growth has exceeded the growth in working-age population this past year by almost 1/2 percentage point.  While somewhat less than the spread between these growth rates over much of the past few years, this excess is still large enough to continue the further tightening of labor markets.  It implies that real GDP is growing faster than its potential.  To an important extent, this excess of the growth of demand over supply owes to the wealth effect as consumers increasingly perceive their capital gains in the stock and housing markets as permanent and, evidently as a consequence, spend part of them, an issue to which I shall return shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be little doubt that, if the pool of job seekers shrinks sufficiently, upward pressures on wage costs are inevitable, short--as I have put it previously--of a repeal of the law of supply and demand.  Such cost increases have invariably presaged rising inflation in the past, and presumably would in the future, which would threaten the economic expansion. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy themselves, neither rising wages nor swelling employment rolls pose a risk to sustained economic growth.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve welcomes such developments and has attempted to gauge its policy in recent years to allow the economy to realize its full, enhanced potential.  In doing so, we must remain concerned with evolving shorter-run imbalances that can constrain long-run economic expansion and job growth.\\r\\n \\r\\n With productivity growth boosting both aggregate demand and aggregate supply, the implications for the real market interest rates that are consistent with sustainable economic growth are not obvious.  In fact, current real rates, although somewhat high by historical standards, have been consistent with continuing rapid growth in an environment where, as a consequence of greater productivity growth, capital gains and high returns on investment give both households and businesses enhanced incentives to spend.\\r\\n\\nOther Considerations\\r\\nEven if labor supply and demand were in balance, however, other aspects of the economic environment may exhibit imbalances that could have important implications for future developments.  For example, in recent years, as a number of analysts have pointed out, a significant shortfall has emerged in the private saving with which to finance domestic investment in plant and equipment and houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne offset to the decline in household saving out of income has been a major shift of the federal budget to surplus.  Of course, an important part of that budgetary improvement, in turn, owes to augmented revenues from capital gains and other taxes that have flowed from the rising market value of assets.  Still, the budget surpluses have helped to hold down interest rates and facilitate private spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n The remaining gap between private saving and domestic investment has been filled by a sizable increase in saving invested from abroad, largely a consequence of the technologically driven marked increase in rates of return on U.S. investments.  Moreover, in recent years, with many foreign economies faltering, U.S. investments have looked particularly attractive.  As U.S. international indebtedness mounts, however, and foreign economies revive, capital inflows from abroad that enable domestic investment to exceed domestic saving may be difficult to sustain.  Any resulting decline in demand for dollar assets could well be associated with higher market interest rates, unless domestic saving rebounds.\\r\\n\\nNear-Term Outlook\\r\\nGoing forward, the Members of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks believe there are mechanisms in place that should help to slow the growth of spending to a pace more consistent with that of potential output growth.  Consumption growth should slow some, if, as seems most likely, outsized gains in share values are not repeated.  In that event, businesses may trim their capital spending plans, a tendency that would be reinforced by the higher level of market interest rates that borrowers now face.  But with large unexploited long-term profit opportunities stemming from still-burgeoning innovations and falling prices of many capital goods, the typical cyclical retrenchment could be muted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking to offset somewhat this anticipated slowing of the growth of domestic demand, our export markets can be expected to be more buoyant because of the revival in growth in many of our important trading partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter considering the various forces at work in the near term, most of the Federal Reserve governors and Bank presidents expect the growth rate of real GDP to be between 3-1/2 and 3-3/4 percent over the four quarters of 1999 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 2000.  The unemployment rate is expected to remain in the range of the past eighteen months.  \\r\\n \\r\\n Inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the consumer price index, is expected to be 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent over the four quarters of this year.  CPI increases thus far in 1999 have been greater than the average in 1998, but the governors and bank presidents do not anticipate a further pickup in inflation going forward.  An abatement of the recent run-up in energy prices would contribute to such a pattern, but policymakers' forecasts also reflect their determination to hold the line on inflation, through policy actions if necessary.  The central tendency of their CPI inflation forecasts for 2000 is 2 to 2-1/2 percent.\\r\\n\\nPreemptive Policymaking\\r\\nIn its deliberations this year, the FOMC has had to wrestle with the issue of what policy setting has the capacity to sustain this remarkable expansion, now in its ninth year.  For monetary policy to foster maximum sustainable economic growth, it is useful to preempt forces of imbalance before they threaten economic stability.  But this may not always be possible--the future at times can be too opaque to penetrate.  When we can be preemptive, we should be, because modest preemptive actions can obviate more drastic actions at a later date that could destabilize the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should emphasize that preemptive policymaking is equally applicable in both directions, as has been evident over the years both in our inclination to raise interest rates when the potential for inflationary pressures emerged, as in the spring of 1994, or to lower rates when the more palpable risk was economic weakness, as in the fall of last year.  This even-handedness is necessary because emerging adverse trends may fall on either side of our long-run objective of price stability.  Stable prices allow households and firms to concentrate their efforts on what they do best: consuming, producing, saving, and investing.  A rapidly rising or a falling general price level would confound market signals and place strains on the system that ultimately may throttle economic expansion.\\r\\n \\r\\n In the face of uncertainty, the Federal Reserve at times has been willing to move policy based on an assessment that risks to the outlook were disproportionately skewed in one direction or the other, rather than on a firm conviction that, absent action, the economy would develop imbalances.  For instance, both the modest policy tightening of the spring of 1997 and some portion of the easing of last fall could be viewed as insurance against potential adverse economic outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have already indicated, by its June meeting the FOMC was of the view that the full extent of this insurance was no longer needed.  It also did not believe that its recent modest tightening would put the risks of inflation going forward completely into balance.  However, given the many uncertainties surrounding developments on both the supply and demand side of the economy, the FOMC did not want to foster the impression that it was committed in short order to tighten further.  Rather, it judged that it would need to evaluate the incoming data for more signs that further imbalances were likely to develop.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Preemptive policymaking requires that the Federal Reserve continually monitor economic conditions, update forecasts, and appraise the setting of its policy instrument.  Equity prices figure importantly in that forecasting process because they influence aggregate demand.  As I testified last month, the central bank cannot effectively directly target stock or other asset prices.  Should an asset bubble arise, or even if one is already in train, monetary policy properly calibrated can doubtless mitigate at least part of the impact on the economy.  And, obviously, if we could find a way to prevent or deflate emerging bubbles, we would be better off.  But identifying a bubble in the process of inflating may be among the most formidable challenges confronting a central bank, pitting its own assessment of fundamentals against the combined judgment of millions of investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy itself, the interpretation that we are currently enjoying productivity acceleration does not ensure that equity prices are not overextended.  There can be little doubt that if the nation's productivity growth has stepped up, the level of profits and their future potential would be elevated.  That prospect has supported higher stock prices.  The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future become relatively small.  Such straying above fundamentals could create problems for our economy when the inevitable adjustment occurs.  It is the job of economic policymakers to mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next expansion.\\r\\n\\nCentury Date Change Preparations\\r\\nI would be remiss in this overview of near-term economic developments if I did not relay the ongoing efforts of the Federal Reserve, other financial regulators, and the private sector to come to grips with the rollover of their computer systems at the start of the upcoming century.  While I have been in this business too long to promise that 2000 will open on an entirely trouble-free note, the efforts to address potential problems in the banking and financial system have been exhaustive.  For our part, the Federal Reserve System has now completed remediation and testing of all its mission-critical applications, including testing its securities and funds-transfer systems with our thousands of financial institution customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n As we have said previously, while we do not believe consumers need to hold excess cash because we expect the full array of payment options to work, we have taken precautions to ensure that ample currency is available.  Further, the Federal Reserve established a special liquidity facility at which sound depository institutions with good collateral can readily borrow at a slight penalty rate in the months surrounding the rollover.  The availability of this back-stop funding should make depository institutions more willing to provide loans and lines of credit to other financial institutions and businesses and to meet any deposit withdrawals as this century closes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banking industry is also working hard, and with evident success, to prepare for the event.  By the end of May, 98 percent of the nation's depository institutions examined by Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council agencies were making satisfactory progress on their Year 2000 preparations.  The agencies are now in the process of examining supervised institutions for compliance with the June 30 milestone date for completing testing and implementation of remediated mission-critical systems.  Supervisors also expect institutions to prepare business resumption contingency plans and to maintain open lines of communication with customers and counterparties about their own readiness.  The few remaining laggards among financial institutions in Year 2000 preparedness have been targeted for additional follow-up and, as necessary, will be subject to formal enforcement actions.\\r\\n\\nConclusion\\r\\n As a result of our nation's ongoing favorable economic performance, not only has the broad majority of our people moved to a higher standard of living, but a strong economy also has managed to bring into the productive workforce many who had for too long been at its periphery.  The unemployment rate for those with less than a high-school education has declined from 10-3/4 percent in early 1994 to 6-3/4 percent today, twice the percentage point decline in the overall unemployment rate.  These gains have enabled large segments of our society to obtain skills on the job and the self-esteem associated with work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe questions before us today are what macroeconomic policy settings can best extend this favorable performance.  No doubt, a monetary policy focused on promoting price stability over the long run and a fiscal policy focused on enhancing national saving by accumulating budget surpluses have been key elements in creating an environment fostering the capital investment that has driven the gains to productivity and living standards.  I am confident that by maintaining this discipline, policymakers in the Congress, in the executive branch, and at the Federal Reserve will give our vital U.S. economy its best chance of continuing its remarkable progress.\\r\\n\\nJuly 1999 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 1999 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 28, 1999, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- February 24, 1998\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual monetary policy report\\r\\nBefore the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy\\r\\nof the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\r\\nFebruary 24, 1998\\n\\r\\n               Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I\\r\\n          welcome this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s\\r\\n          semiannual report on economic conditions and the\\r\\n          conduct of monetary policy.\\r\\n\\nThe U.S. Economy in 1997\\n\\r\\n               The U.S. economy delivered another exemplary\\r\\n          performance in 1997.  Over the four quarters of last year,\\r\\n          real GDP expanded close to 4 percent, its fastest annual\\r\\n          increase in ten years.  To produce that higher output,\\r\\n          about 3 million Americans joined the nation\\'s payrolls, in\\r\\n          the process contributing to a reduction in the\\r\\n          unemployment rate to 4-3/4 percent, its lowest sustained\\r\\n          level since the late 1960s.  And our factories were working\\r\\n          more intensively too:  Industrial production increased 5-3/4 percent\\r\\n\\t\\t  last year, exceeding robust additions to\\r\\n          capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Those gains were shared widely.  The hourly wage\\r\\n          and salary structure rose about 4 percent, fueling\\r\\n          impressive increases in personal incomes.  Unlike some\\r\\n          prior episodes when faster wage rate increases mainly\\r\\n          reflected attempts to make up for more rapidly rising\\r\\n          prices of goods and services, the fatter paychecks that\\r\\n          workers brought home represented real increments to\\r\\n          purchasing power.  Measured consumer price inflation\\r\\n          came in at 1-3/4 percent over the twelve months of 1997,\\r\\n          down about 1-1/2 percentage points from the pace of the\\r\\n          prior year.  While swings in the prices of food and fuel\\r\\n          contributed to this decline, both narrower price indexes\\r\\n          excluding those items and broader ones including all goods\\r\\n          and services produced in the United States also paint a\\r\\n          portrait of continued progress toward price stability.\\r\\n          Businesses, for the most part, were able to pay these\\r\\n          higher real wages while still increasing their earnings.\\r\\n          Although aggregate data on profits for all of 1997 are not\\r\\n          yet available, corporate profit margins most likely\\r\\n          remained in an elevated range not seen consistently since\\r\\n          the 1960s.  These healthy gains in earnings and the\\r\\n          expectations of more to come provided important support\\r\\n          to the equity market, with most major stock price indexes\\r\\n          gaining more than 20 percent over the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The strong growth of the real income of workers\\r\\n          and corporations is not unrelated to the economy\\'s\\r\\n          continued good performance on inflation.  Taken together,\\r\\n          recent evidence supports the view that such low inflation,\\r\\n          as closely approaching price stability as we have known in\\r\\n          the United States in three decades, engenders many\\r\\n          benefits.  When changes in the general price level are\\r\\n          small and predictable, households and firms can plan more\\r\\n          securely for the future.  The perception of reduced risk\\r\\n          encourages investment.  Low inflation also exerts a\\r\\n          discipline on costs, fostering efforts to enhance\\r\\n          productivity.  Productivity is the ultimate source of rising\\r\\n          standards of living, and we witnessed a notable pickup in\\r\\n          this measure in the past two years.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The robust economy has facilitated the efforts of\\r\\n          the Congress and the Administration to restore balance in\\r\\n          the unified federal budget.  As I have indicated to the\\r\\n          Congress on numerous occasions, moving beyond this\\r\\n          point and putting the budget in significant surplus would\\r\\n          be the surest and most direct way of increasing national\\r\\n          saving.  In turn, higher national saving, by promoting\\r\\n          lower real long-term interest rates, helps spur spending to\\r\\n          outfit American firms and their workers with the modern\\r\\n          equipment they need to compete successfully on world\\r\\n          markets.  We have seen a partial down payment of the\\r\\n          benefits of better budget balance already:  It seems\\r\\n          reasonable to assume that the decline in longer-term\\r\\n          Treasury yields last year owed, in part, to reduced\\r\\n          competition--current and prospective--from the federal\\r\\n          government for scarce private saving.  However, additional\\r\\n          effort remains to be exerted to address the effects on\\r\\n          federal entitlement spending of the looming shift within\\r\\n          the next decade in the nation\\'s retirement demographics.\\r\\n\\r\\n               As I noted earlier, our nation has been experiencing\\r\\n          a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour\\r\\n          worked--in recent years.  The dramatic improvements in\\r\\n          computing power and communication and information\\r\\n          technology appear to have been a major force behind this\\r\\n          beneficial trend.  Those innovations, together with fierce\\r\\n          competitive pressures in our high-tech industries to make\\r\\n          them available to as many homes, offices, stores, and shop\\r\\n          floors as possible, have produced double-digit annual\\r\\n          reductions in prices of capital goods embodying new\\r\\n          technologies.  Indeed, many products considered to be at\\r\\n          the cutting edge of technology as recently as two to three\\r\\n          years ago have become so standardized and inexpensive\\r\\n          that they have achieved near \"commodity\" status, a\\r\\n          development that has allowed businesses to accelerate\\r\\n          their accumulation of more and better capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Critical to this process has been the rapidly\\r\\n          increasing efficiency of our financial markets--itself a\\r\\n          product of the new technologies and of significant market\\r\\n          deregulation over the years.  Capital now flows with\\r\\n          relatively little friction to projects embodying new ideas.\\r\\n          Silicon Valley is a tribute both to American ingenuity and\\r\\n          to the financial system\\'s ever-increasing ability to supply\\r\\n          venture capital to the entrepreneurs who are such a\\r\\n          dynamic force in our economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n               With new high-tech tools, American businesses have\\r\\n          shaved transportation costs, managed their production and\\r\\n          use of inventories more efficiently, and broadened market\\r\\n          opportunities.   The threat of rising costs in tight labor\\r\\n          markets has imparted a substantial impetus to efforts to\\r\\n          take advantage of possible efficiencies.  In my Humphrey-Hawkins\\r\\n\\t\\t  testimony last July, I discussed the likelihood\\r\\n          that the sharp acceleration in capital investment in\\r\\n          advanced technologies beginning in 1993 reflected\\r\\n          synergies of new ideas, embodied in increasingly\\r\\n          inexpensive new equipment, that have elevated expected\\r\\n          returns and have broadened investment opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\n               More recent evidence remains consistent with the\\r\\n          view that this capital spending has contributed to a\\r\\n          noticeable pickup in productivity--and probably by more\\r\\n          than can be explained by usual business cycle forces.  For\\r\\n          one, the combination of continued low inflation and\\r\\n          stable to rising domestic profit margins implies quite\\r\\n          subdued growth in total consolidated unit business costs.\\r\\n          With labor costs constituting more than two-thirds of\\r\\n          those costs and labor compensation per hour accelerating,\\r\\n          productivity must be growing faster, and that stepup must\\r\\n          be roughly in line with the increase in compensation\\r\\n          growth.  For another, our more direct observations on\\r\\n          output per hour roughly tend to confirm that productivity\\r\\n          has picked up significantly in recent years, although how\\r\\n          much the ongoing trend of productivity has risen remains\\r\\n          an open question.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The acceleration in productivity, however, has been\\r\\n          exceeded by the strengthening of demand for goods and\\r\\n          services.  As a consequence, employers had to expand\\r\\n          payrolls at a pace well in excess of the growth of the\\r\\n          working age population that profess a desire for a job,\\r\\n          including new immigrants.  As I pointed out last year in\\r\\n          testimony before the Congress, that gap has been\\r\\n          accommodated by declines in both the officially\\r\\n          unemployed and those not actively seeking work but\\r\\n          desirous of working.  The number of people in those two\\r\\n          categories decreased at a rate of about one million per year\\r\\n          on average over the last four years.  By December 1997,\\r\\n          the sum had declined to a seasonally adjusted 10-1/2\\r\\n          million, or 6 percent of the working age population, the\\r\\n          lowest ratio since detailed information on this series first\\r\\n          became available in 1970.  Anecdotal information from\\r\\n          surveys of our twelve Reserve Banks attests to our ever\\r\\n          tightening labor markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Rapidly rising demand for labor has had enormous\\r\\n          beneficial effects on our work force.  Previously low- or\\r\\n          unskilled workers have been drawn into the job market\\r\\n          and have obtained training and experience that will help\\r\\n          them even if they later change jobs.  Large numbers of\\r\\n          underemployed have been moved up the career ladder to\\r\\n          match their underlying skills, and many welfare recipients\\r\\n          have been added to payrolls as well, to the benefit of their\\r\\n          long-term job prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The recent acceleration of wages likely has owed in\\r\\n          part to the ever-tightening labor market and in part to\\r\\n          rising productivity growth, which, through competition,\\r\\n          induces firms to grant higher wages.  It is difficult at this\\r\\n          time, however, to disentangle the relative contributions of\\r\\n          these factors.  What is clear is that, unless demand growth\\r\\n          softens or productivity growth accelerates even more, we\\r\\n          will gradually run out of new workers who can be\\r\\n          profitably employed.  It is not possible to tell how many\\r\\n          more of the 6 percent of the working-age population who\\r\\n          want to work but do not have jobs can be added to\\r\\n          payrolls.  A significant number are so-called frictionally\\r\\n          unemployed, as they have left one job but not yet chosen\\r\\n          to accept another.  Still others have chosen to work in\\r\\n          only a limited geographic area where their skills may not\\r\\n          be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Should demand for new workers continue to exceed\\r\\n          new supply, we would expect wage gains increasingly to\\r\\n          exceed productivity growth, squeezing profit margins and\\r\\n          eventually leading to a pickup in inflation.  Were a\\r\\n          substantial pickup in inflation to occur, it could, by\\r\\n          stunting economic growth, reverse much of the remarkable\\r\\n          labor market progress of recent years.  I will be discussing\\r\\n          our assessment of these and other possibilities and their\\r\\n          bearing on the outlook for 1998 shortly.\\r\\n\\nMonetary Policy in 1997\\n\\r\\n               History teaches us that monetary policy has been\\r\\n          its most effective when it has been preemptive.  The\\r\\n          lagging relationship between the Federal Reserve\\'s policy\\r\\n          instrument and spending, and, even further removed,\\r\\n          inflation, implies that if policy actions are delayed until\\r\\n          prices begin to pick up, they will be too late to fend off at\\r\\n          least some persistent price acceleration and attendant\\r\\n          economic instabilities.  Preemptive policymaking is keyed\\r\\n          to judging how widespread are emerging inflationary\\r\\n          forces, and when, and to what degree, those forces will be\\r\\n          reflected in actual inflation.  For most of last year, the\\r\\n          evident strains on resources were sufficiently severe to\\r\\n          steer the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\\r\\n          toward being more inclined to tighten than to ease\\r\\n          monetary policy.  Indeed, in March, when it became\\r\\n          apparent that strains on resources seemed to be\\r\\n          intensifying, the FOMC imposed modest incremental\\r\\n          restraint, raising its intended federal funds rate 1/4\\r\\n          percentage point, to 5-1/2 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n               We did not increase the federal funds rate again\\r\\n          during the summer and fall, despite further tightening of\\r\\n          the labor market.  Even though the labor market heated\\r\\n          up and labor compensation rose, measured inflation fell,\\r\\n          owing to the appreciation of the dollar, weakness in\\r\\n          international commodity prices, and faster productivity\\r\\n          growth.  Those restraining forces were more evident in\\r\\n          goods-price inflation, which in the CPI slowed\\r\\n          substantially to only about 1/2 percent in 1997, than on\\r\\n          service-price inflation, which moderated much less--to\\r\\n          around 3 percent.  Providers of services appeared to be\\r\\n          more pressed by mounting strains in labor markets.\\r\\n          Hourly wages and salaries in service-producing sectors rose\\r\\n          4-1/2 percent last year, up considerably from the prior\\r\\n          year and almost 1-1/2 percentage points faster than in\\r\\n          goods-producing sectors.  However, a significant portion of\\r\\n          that differential, but by no means all, traced to\\r\\n          commissions in the financial and real estate services sector\\r\\n          related to one-off increases in transactions prices and in\\r\\n          volumes of activity, rather than to increases in the\\r\\n          underlying wage structure.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Although the nominal federal funds rate was\\r\\n          maintained after March, the apparent drop in inflation\\r\\n          expectations over the balance of 1997 induced some\\r\\n          firming in the stance of monetary policy by one important\\r\\n          measure--the real federal funds rate, or the nominal federal\\r\\n          funds rate less a proxy for inflation expectations.  Some\\r\\n          analysts have dubbed the contribution of the reduction in\\r\\n          inflation expectations to raising the real federal funds rate\\r\\n          a \"passive\" tightening, in that it increased the amount of\\r\\n          monetary policy restraint in place without an explicit vote\\r\\n          by the FOMC.  While the tightening may have been\\r\\n          passive in that sense, it was by no means inadvertent.\\r\\n          Members of the FOMC took some comfort in the upward\\r\\n          trend of the real federal funds rate over the year and the\\r\\n          rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar because\\r\\n          such additional restraint was viewed as appropriate given\\r\\n          the strength of spending and building strains on labor\\r\\n          resources.  They also recognized that in virtually all other\\r\\n          respects financial markets remained quite accommodative\\r\\n          and, indeed, judging by the rise in equity prices, were\\r\\n          providing additional impetus to domestic spending.\\r\\n\\nThe Outlook for 1998\\n\\r\\n               There can be no doubt that domestic demand\\r\\n          retained considerable momentum at the outset of this\\r\\n          year.  Production and employment have been on a strong\\r\\n          uptrend in recent months.  Confident households,\\r\\n          enjoying gains in income and wealth and benefitting from\\r\\n          the reductions in intermediate- and longer-term interest\\r\\n          rates to date, should continue to increase their spending.\\r\\n          Firms should find financing available on relatively\\r\\n          attractive terms to fund profitable opportunities to\\r\\n          enhance efficiency by investing in new capital equipment.\\r\\n          By itself, this strength in spending would seem to presage\\r\\n          intensifying pressures in labor markets and on prices.  Yet,\\r\\n          the outlook for total spending on goods and services\\r\\n          produced in the United States is less assured of late\\r\\n          because of storm clouds massing over the Western Pacific\\r\\n          and heading our way.\\r\\n\\r\\n               This is not the place to examine in detail what\\r\\n          triggered the initial problems in Asian financial markets\\r\\n          and why the subsequent deterioration has been so\\r\\n          extreme.  I covered that subject recently before several\\r\\n          committees of the Congress.  Rather, I shall confine my\\r\\n          discussion this morning to the likely consequences of the\\r\\n          Asian crisis for demand and inflation in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n               With the crisis curtailing the financing available in\\r\\n          foreign currencies, many Asian economies have had no\\r\\n          choice but to cut back their imports sharply.  Disruptions\\r\\n          to their financial systems and economies more generally\\r\\n          will further damp demands for our exports of goods and\\r\\n          services.  American exports should be held down as well by\\r\\n          the appreciation of the dollar, which will make the prices\\r\\n          of competing goods produced abroad more attractive, just\\r\\n          as foreign-produced goods will be relatively more attractive\\r\\n          to buyers here at home.  As a result, we can expect a\\r\\n          worsening net export position to exert a discernible drag\\r\\n          on total output in the United States.  For a time, such\\r\\n          restraint might be reinforced by a reduced willingness of\\r\\n          U.S. firms to accumulate inventories as they foresee\\r\\n          weaker demand ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The forces of Asian restraint could well be providing\\r\\n          another, more direct offset to inflationary impulses arising\\r\\n          domestically in the United States.  In the wake of\\r\\n          weakness in Asian economies and of lagged effects of the\\r\\n          appreciation of the dollar more generally, the dollar prices\\r\\n          of our non-oil imports are likely to decline further in the\\r\\n          months ahead.  These lower import prices are apparently\\r\\n          already making domestic producers hesitant to raise their\\r\\n          own prices for fear of losing market share, further\\r\\n          contributing to the restraint on overall prices.  Lesser\\r\\n          demands for raw materials on the part of Asian economies\\r\\n          as their activity slows should help to keep world\\r\\n          commodity prices denominated in dollars in check.\\r\\n          Import and commodity prices, however, will restrain U.S.\\r\\n          inflation only as long as they continue to fall, or to rise at\\r\\n          a slower rate than the pace of overall domestic product\\r\\n          prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The key question going forward is whether the\\r\\n          restraint building from the turmoil in Asia will be\\r\\n          sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might\\r\\n          otherwise result from the strength of domestic spending\\r\\n          and tightening labor markets.  The depth of the\\r\\n          adjustment abroad will depend on the extent of weakness\\r\\n          in the financial sectors of Asian economies and the speed\\r\\n          with which structural inefficiencies in the financial and\\r\\n          nonfinancial sectors of those economies are corrected.  If,\\r\\n          as we suspect, the restraint coming from Asia is sufficient\\r\\n          to bring the demand for American labor back into line\\r\\n          with the growth of the working-age population desirous of\\r\\n          working, labor markets will remain unusually tight, but\\r\\n          any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very\\r\\n          gradual, and readily reversible.  However, we cannot rule\\r\\n          out two other, more worrisome possibilities.  On the one\\r\\n          hand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be\\r\\n          offset significantly by Asian or other developments, the\\r\\n          U.S. economy would be on a track along which spending\\r\\n          could press too strongly against available resources to be\\r\\n          consistent with contained inflation.  On the other, we also\\r\\n          need to be alert to the possibility that the forces from Asia\\r\\n          might damp activity and prices by more than is desirable\\r\\n          by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of\\r\\n          net exports and the prices of imports.\\r\\n\\r\\n               When confronted at the beginning of this month\\r\\n          with these, for the moment, finely balanced, though\\r\\n          powerful forces, the members of the Federal Open Market\\r\\n          Committee decided that monetary policy should most\\r\\n          appropriately be kept on hold.  With the continuation of\\r\\n          a remarkable seven-year expansion at stake and so little\\r\\n          precedent to go by, the range of our intelligence gathering\\r\\n          in the weeks ahead must be wide and especially inclusive\\r\\n          of international developments.\\r\\n          The Forecasts of the Governors of the Federal Reserve\\r\\n          Board and the Presidents of the Federal Reserve\\r\\n          Banks.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In these circumstances, the forecasts of the\\r\\n          governors of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of\\r\\n          the Federal Reserve Banks for the performance of the U.S\\r\\n          economy over this year are more tentative than usual.\\r\\n          Based on information available through the first week of\\r\\n          February, monetary policymakers were generally of the\\r\\n          view that moderate economic growth is likely in store.\\r\\n          The growth rate of real GDP is most commonly seen as\\r\\n          between 2 and 2-3/4 percent over the four quarters of\\r\\n          1998.  Given the strong performance of real GDP, these\\r\\n          projections envisage the unemployment rate remaining in\\r\\n          the low range of the past half year.  Inflation, as measured\\r\\n          by the four-quarter percent change in the consumer price\\r\\n          index, is expected to be 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent in 1998--near\\r\\n\\t\\t   the low rate recorded in 1997.  This outlook\\r\\n          embodies the expectation that the effects of continuing\\r\\n          tightness in labor markets will be largely offset by\\r\\n          technical adjustments shaving a couple tenths from the\\r\\n          published CPI, healthy productivity growth, flat or\\r\\n          declining import prices, and little pressure in commodity\\r\\n          markets.  But the policymakers\\' forecasts also reflect their\\r\\n          determination to hold the line on inflation.\\r\\n\\nThe Ranges for the Debt and Monetary Aggregates\\n\\r\\n               The FOMC affirmed the provisional ranges for the\\r\\n          monetary aggregates in 1998 that it had selected last July,\\r\\n          which, once again, encompass the growth rates associated\\r\\n          with conditions of approximate price stability, provided\\r\\n          that these aggregates act in accord with their pre-1990s\\r\\n          historical relationships with nominal income and interest\\r\\n          rates.  These ranges are identical to those that had\\r\\n          prevailed for 1997--1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6\\r\\n          percent for M3.  The FOMC also reaffirmed its range of 3\\r\\n          to 7 percent for the debt of the domestic nonfinancial\\r\\n          sectors for this year.  I should caution, though, that the\\r\\n          expectations of the governors and Reserve Bank presidents\\r\\n          for the expansion of nominal GDP in 1998 suggest that\\r\\n          growth of M2 in the upper half of its benchmark range is\\r\\n          a distinct possibility this year.  Given the continuing\\r\\n          strength of bank credit, M3 might even be above its range\\r\\n          as depositories use liabilities in this aggregate to fund loan\\r\\n          growth and securities acquisitions.  Nonfinancial debt\\r\\n          should come in around the middle portion of its range.\\r\\n          In the first part of the 1990s, money growth\\r\\n          diverged from historical relationships with income and\\r\\n          interest rates, in part as savers diversified into bond and\\r\\n          stock mutual funds, which had become more readily\\r\\n          available and whose returns were considerably more\\r\\n          attractive than those on deposits.  This anomalous\\r\\n          behavior of velocity severely set back most analysts\\'\\r\\n          confidence in the usefulness of M2 as an indicator of\\r\\n          economic developments.  In recent years, there have been\\r\\n          tentative signs that the historical relationship linking the\\r\\n          velocity of M2--measured as the ratio of nominal GDP to\\r\\n          the money stock--to the cost of holding M2 assets was\\r\\n          reasserting itself.  However, a persistent residual upward\\r\\n          drift in velocity over the past few years and its apparent\\r\\n          cessation very recently underscores our ongoing\\r\\n          uncertainty about the stability of this relationship.  The\\r\\n          FOMC will continue to observe the evolution of the\\r\\n          monetary and credit aggregates carefully, integrating\\r\\n          information about these variables with a wide variety of\\r\\n          other information in determining its policy stance.\\r\\n\\nUncertainty about the Outlook\\n\\r\\n               With the current situation reflecting a balance of\\r\\n          strong countervailing forces, events in the months ahead\\r\\n          are not likely to unfold smoothly.  In that regard, I would\\r\\n          like to flag a few areas of concern about the economy\\r\\n          beyond those mentioned already regarding Asian\\r\\n          developments.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Without doubt, lenders have provided important\\r\\n          support to spending in the past few years by their\\r\\n          willingness to transact at historically small margins and in\\r\\n          large volumes.  Equity investors have contributed as well\\r\\n          by apparently pricing in the expectation of substantial\\r\\n          earnings gains and requiring modest compensation for the\\r\\n          risk that those expectations could be mistaken.\\r\\n          Approaching the eighth year of the economic expansion,\\r\\n          this is understandable in an economic environment that,\\r\\n          contrary to historical experience, has become increasingly\\r\\n          benign.  Businesses have been meeting obligations readily\\r\\n          and generating high profits, putting them in outstanding\\r\\n          financial health.\\r\\n\\r\\n               But we must be concerned about becoming too\\r\\n          complacent about evaluating repayment risks.  All too\\r\\n          often at this stage of the business cycle, the loans that\\r\\n          banks extend later make up a disproportionate share of\\r\\n          total nonperforming loans.  In addition, quite possibly,\\r\\n          twelve or eighteen months hence, some of the securities\\r\\n          purchased on the market could be looked upon with some\\r\\n          regret by investors.  As one of the nation\\'s bank\\r\\n          supervisors, the Federal Reserve will make every effort to\\r\\n          encourage banks to apply sound underwriting standards in\\r\\n          their lending.  Prudent lenders should consider a wide\\r\\n          range of economic situations in evaluating credit; to do\\r\\n          otherwise would risk contributing to potentially disruptive\\r\\n          financial problems down the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n               A second area of concern involves our nation\\'s\\r\\n          continuing role in the new high-tech international\\r\\n          financial system.  By joining with our major trading\\r\\n          partners and international financial institutions in helping\\r\\n          to stabilize the economies of Asia and promoting needed\\r\\n          structural changes, we are also encouraging the continued\\r\\n          expansion of world trade and global economic and\\r\\n          financial stability on which the ongoing increase of our\\r\\n          own standards of living depends.  If we were to cede our\\r\\n          role as a world leader, or backslide into protectionist\\r\\n          policies, we would threaten the source of much of our own\\r\\n          sustained economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n               A third risk is complacency about inflation\\r\\n          prospects.  The combination and interaction of significant\\r\\n          increases in productivity-improving technologies, sharp\\r\\n          declines in budget deficits, and disciplined monetary\\r\\n          policy has damped product price changes, bringing them\\r\\n          to near stability.  While part of this result owes to good\\r\\n          policy, part is the product of the fortuitous emergence of\\r\\n          new technologies and of some favorable price\\r\\n          developments in imported goods.  However, as history\\r\\n          counsels, it is unwise to count on any string of good\\r\\n          fortune to continue indefinitely.  At the same time,\\r\\n          though, it is also instructive to remember the words of an\\r\\n          old sage that \"luck is the residue of design.\"  He meant\\r\\n          that to some degree we can deliberately put ourselves in\\r\\n          position to experience good fortune and be better prepared\\r\\n          when misfortune strikes.  For example, the 1970s were\\r\\n          marked by two major oil-price shocks and a significant\\r\\n          depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar.  But\\r\\n          those misfortunes were, in part, the result of allowing\\r\\n          imbalances to build over the decade as policymakers lost\\r\\n          hold of the anchor provided by price stability.  Some of\\r\\n          what we now see helping rein in inflation pressures is more\\r\\n          likely to occur in an environment of stable prices and price\\r\\n          expectations that thwarts producers from indiscriminately\\r\\n          passing on higher costs, puts a premium on productivity\\r\\n          enhancement, and rewards more effectively investment in\\r\\n          physical and human capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Simply put, while the pursuit of price stability does\\r\\n          not rule out misfortune, it lowers its probability.  If firms\\r\\n          are convinced that the general price level will remain\\r\\n          stable, they will reserve increases in their sales prices of\\r\\n          goods and services as a last resort, for fear that such\\r\\n          increases could mean loss of market share.  Similarly, if\\r\\n          households are convinced of price stability, they will not\\r\\n          see variations in relative prices as reasons to change their\\r\\n          long-run inflation expectations.  Thus, continuing to make\\r\\n          progress toward this legislated objective will make future\\r\\n          supply shocks less likely and our nation\\'s economy less\\r\\n          vulnerable to those that occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nFebruary 1998 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 1998 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 21, 1998, 10:15 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- July 21, 1998\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate \\r\\nJuly 21, 1998\\n\\nChairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, July 22, 1998\\n\\r\\n         Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I\\r\\n         appreciate this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's\\r\\n         midyear report on monetary policy.\\n\\r\\n              Overall, the performance of the U.S. economy\\r\\n         continues to be impressive.  Over the first part of the year, we\\r\\n         experienced further gains in output and employment, subdued\\r\\n         prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  Important\\r\\n         crosscurrents, however, have been impacting the economy.\\r\\n         With labor markets very tight and domestic final demand\\r\\n         retaining considerable momentum, the risks of a pickup in\\r\\n         inflation remain significant.  But inventory investment, which\\r\\n         was quite rapid late last year and early this year, appears to\\r\\n         have slowed, perhaps appreciably. Moreover, the economic\\r\\n         and financial troubles in Asian economies are now\\r\\n         demonstrably restraining demands for U.S. goods and\\r\\n         services--and those troubles could intensify and spread further.\\r\\n         Weighing these forces, the Federal Open Market Committee\\r\\n         chose to keep the stance of policy unchanged over the first half\\r\\n         of 1998.  However, should pressures on labor resources begin\\r\\n         to show through more impressively in cost increases, policy\\r\\n         action may need to counter any associated tendency for prices\\r\\n         to accelerate before it undermines this extraordinary\\r\\n         expansion.\\r\\n\\nRecent Developments\\n\\r\\n              When I appeared before your committee in February, I\\r\\n         noted that a key question for monetary policy was whether the\\r\\n         consequences of the turmoil in Asia would be sufficient to\\r\\n         check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from\\r\\n         the strength of domestic spending and tightening labor\\r\\n         markets.  After the economy's surge in 1996 and, especially,\\r\\n         last year, resource utilization, particularly that of the labor\\r\\n         force, had risen to a very high level.  Although some signs\\r\\n         pointed to stepped-up increases in productivity, the speed at\\r\\n         which the demand for goods and services had been growing\\r\\n         clearly exceeded the rate of expansion of the economy's\\r\\n         long-run potential to produce.  Maintenance of such a pace\\r\\n         would put even greater pressures on the economy's resources,\\r\\n         threatening the balance and longevity of the expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n              However, it appeared likely that the difficulties being\\r\\n         encountered by Asian economies, by cutting into U.S. exports,\\r\\n         would be a potentially important factor slowing the growth of\\r\\n         aggregate demand in the United States.  But uncertainties\\r\\n         about the timing and dimensions of that development were\\r\\n         considerable given the difficulties in assessing the extent of the\\r\\n         problems in East Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\n              In the event, the contraction of output and incomes in a\\r\\n         number of Asian economies has turned out to be more\\r\\n         substantial than most had anticipated.  Moreover, financial\\r\\n         markets in Asia and in emerging market economies generally\\r\\n         have remained unsettled, portending further difficult\\r\\n         adjustments.  The contraction in Asian economies, along with\\r\\n         the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over 1997,\\r\\n         prompted a sharp deterioration in the U.S. balance of trade in\\r\\n         the first quarter.  Nonetheless, the American economy proved\\r\\n         to be unexpectedly robust in that period.  The growth of real\\r\\n         GDP not only failed to slow, it climbed further, to about a 5-1/2\\r\\n         percent annual rate in the first quarter, according to the current\\r\\n         national income accounts.  Domestic private demand for goods\\r\\n         and services--including personal consumption expenditures,\\r\\n         business investment, and residential expenditures--was\\r\\n         exceptionally strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Evidently, optimism about jobs, incomes, and profits,\\r\\n         high and rising wealth-to-income ratios, low financing costs,\\r\\n         and falling prices for high-tech goods fed the appetites of\\r\\n         households and businesses for consumer durables and capital\\r\\n         equipment.  In addition, inventory investment contributed\\r\\n         significantly to growth in the first quarter; indeed, the growth\\r\\n         of stocks of materials and goods outpaced that of overall\\r\\n         output by a wide margin during the first quarter, adding 1\\r\\n         percentage points to the annualized growth rate of GDP.\\r\\n         Although accumulation of some products likely was\\r\\n         unintended, surveys indicate that much of the stockbuilding\\r\\n         probably reflected firms' confidence in the prospects for\\r\\n         continued growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n              As evidence piled up that the economy continued to\\r\\n         run hot during the winter, the Federal Reserve's concerns\\r\\n         about inflationary pressures mounted.  Domestic demand\\r\\n         clearly had more underlying momentum than we had\\r\\n         anticipated, supported in part by financial conditions that were\\r\\n         quite accommodative.  Credit remained extremely easy for\\r\\n         most borrowers to obtain; intermediate- and long-term interest\\r\\n         rates were at relatively low levels; equity prices soared\\r\\n         higher, despite some disappointing earnings reports; and growth\\r\\n         in the monetary aggregates was rapid.  Indeed, the crises in\\r\\n         Asia, by lowering longer-term U.S. interest rates--through\\r\\n         stronger preferences for dollar investments and expectations of\\r\\n         slower growth ahead--and by reducing commodity prices, probably\\r\\n         added to the positive forces boosting domestic spending in the\\r\\n         first half, especially in the interest-sensitive housing sector.\\r\\n         The robust expansion of demand tightened labor markets\\r\\n         further, giving additional impetus to the upward trend in labor\\r\\n         costs.  Inflation was low--though, given the lags with which\\r\\n         monetary policy affects the economy and prices, we had to be\\r\\n         mainly concerned not with conditions at the moment but with\\r\\n         those likely to prevail many months ahead.  In these\\r\\n         circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee elected in\\r\\n         March to move to a state of heightened alert against inflation,\\r\\n         but left the stance of policy unchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Although national income and product data for the\\r\\n         second quarter have not yet been published, growth of U.S.\\r\\n         output appears to have slowed sharply.  The auto strike has\\r\\n         brought General Motor's production essentially to a halt,\\r\\n         probably reducing real GDP in the second quarter by about 1/2\\r\\n         percentage point at an annual rate.  The limited available\\r\\n         information on inventory investment suggests that\\r\\n         stockbuilding dropped markedly from its unsustainable pace of\\r\\n         the first quarter.  In addition to the slower pace of inventory\\r\\n         building, Asian economies have continued to deteriorate,\\r\\n         further retarding our exports in recent months.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Indeed, readings on the elements that make up the real\\r\\n         GDP have led many analysts to anticipate a decline in that\\r\\n         measure in the second quarter, after the first-quarter surge.\\r\\n         Given the upcoming revisions to the national income accounts,\\r\\n         such assessments would have to be regarded as conjectural.  It\\r\\n         is worth noting in any case that other indicators of output,\\r\\n         including worker hours and manufacturing production, show a\\r\\n         somewhat steadier, though slowing, path over the first half of\\r\\n         the year.  And underlying trends in domestic final demand\\r\\n         have remained strong, imparting impetus to the continuing\\r\\n         economic expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n              During the first half of the year, measures of resource\\r\\n         utilization diverged.  Pressures on manufacturing facilities\\r\\n         appeared to be easing.  Plant capacity was growing rapidly as a\\r\\n         result of vigorous investment.  And growth of industrial output\\r\\n         was dropping off from its brisk pace of 1997, importantly\\r\\n         reflecting the deceleration in world demand for manufactured\\r\\n         goods that resulted from the Asian economic difficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\n              But labor markets, in contrast, became increasingly taut\\r\\n         during the first half.  Total payroll jobs rose about\\r\\n         one-and-one-half million over the first six months of the year.\\r\\n         The civilian unemployment rate dropped to a bit below 4-1/2\\r\\n         percent in the second quarter, its lowest level in three\\r\\n         decades.  Firms resorted to a variety of tactics to attract and\\r\\n         retain workers, such as paying various types of monetary bonuses\\r\\n         and raising basic wage rates. But, at least through the first\\r\\n         quarter, the effects of a rising wage bill on production costs\\r\\n         were moderated by strong gains in productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Indeed, inflation stayed remarkably damped during the\\r\\n         first quarter.  The consumer price index as well as broader\\r\\n         measures of prices indicate that inflation moved down further,\\r\\n         even as the economy strengthened.  Although declining oil\\r\\n         prices contributed to this development, pricing leverage in the\\r\\n         goods-producing sector more generally was held in check by\\r\\n         reduced demand from Asia that, among other things, has led to\\r\\n         a softening of commodity prices, a strong dollar that has\\r\\n         contributed to bargain prices on many imports, and rising\\r\\n         industrial capacity.  Service price inflation, less influenced\\r\\n         by international events, has remained steady at about a 3\\r\\n         percent rate since before the beginning of the crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Some elements in the goods price mix clearly were\\r\\n         transitory.  Indeed, the more recent price data suggest that\\r\\n         overall consumer price inflation moved up in the second\\r\\n         quarter.  But, even so, the increase remained moderate.\\r\\n\\r\\n              In any event, it would be a mistake for monetary policy\\r\\n         makers to focus on any single index in gauging inflation\\r\\n         pressures in the economy.  Although much public attention is\\r\\n         directed to the CPI, the Federal Reserve monitors a wide\\r\\n         variety of aggregate price measures.  Each is designed for a\\r\\n         particular purpose and has its own strengths and weaknesses.\\r\\n         Price pressures appear especially absent in some of the\\r\\n         measures in the national income accounts, which are available\\r\\n         through the first quarter.  The chain-weight price index for\\r\\n         personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy,\\r\\n         for example, rose 1.5 percent over the year ending in the first\\r\\n         quarter, considerably less than the 2.3 percent rise in the core\\r\\n         CPI over the same period.  An even broader price measure,\\r\\n         that for overall GDP, rose 1.4 percent.  These indexes, while\\r\\n         certainly subject to many of the measurement difficulties the\\r\\n         Bureau of Labor Statistics has been grappling with in the CPI,\\r\\n         have the advantages that their chain-weighting avoids some\\r\\n         aspects of so-called substitution bias and that already\\r\\n         published data can be revised to incorporate new information\\r\\n         and measurement techniques.  Taken together, while the\\r\\n         various price indexes show some differences, the basic\\r\\n         message is that inflation to date has remained low.\\r\\n\\nEconomic Fundamentals: The Virtuous Cycle\\r\\n\\r\\n              So far this year, our economy has continued to enjoy a\\r\\n         virtuous cycle.  Evidence of accelerated productivity has been\\r\\n         bolstering expectations of future corporate earnings, thereby\\r\\n         fueling still further increases in equity values, and the\\r\\n         improvements in productivity have been helping to reduce\\r\\n         inflation.  In the context of subdued price increases and\\r\\n         generally supportive credit conditions, rising equity values\\r\\n         have provided impetus to spending and, in turn, the expansion\\r\\n         of output, employment, and productivity-enhancing capital\\r\\n         investment.\\r\\n\\r\\n              The essential precondition for the emergence, and\\r\\n         persistence, of this virtuous cycle is arguably the decline in\\r\\n         the rate of inflation to near price stability.  In recent years,\\r\\n         continued low product price inflation and expectations that it\\r\\n         will persist have promoted stability in financial markets and\\r\\n         fostered perceptions that the degree of risk in the financial\\r\\n         outlook has been moving ever lower.  These perceptions, in\\r\\n         turn, have reduced the extra compensation that investors\\r\\n         require for making loans to, or taking ownership positions in,\\r\\n         private firms.  With risks in the domestic economy judged to\\r\\n         be low, credit and equity capital have been readily available\\r\\n         for many businesses, fostering strong investment.  And low\\r\\n         mortgage interest rates have allowed many households to\\r\\n         purchase homes and to refinance outstanding debt.  The\\r\\n         reduction in debt servicing costs has contributed to an apparent\\r\\n         stabilization of the financial strains on the household sector\\r\\n         that seemed to emerge a couple of years ago and has buoyed\\r\\n         consumer demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n              To a considerable extent, investors seem to be\\r\\n         expecting that low inflation and stronger productivity growth\\r\\n         will allow the extraordinary growth of profits to be extended\\r\\n         into the distant future.  Indeed, expectations of earnings\\r\\n         growth over the longer term have been undergoing continual\\r\\n         upward revision by security analysts since early 1995.  These\\r\\n         rising expectations have, in turn, driven stock prices sharply\\r\\n         higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps in both cases to levels\\r\\n         that will be difficult to sustain unless the virtuous cycle\\r\\n         continues.  In any event, primarily because of the rise in stock\\r\\n         prices, about $12-1/2 trillion has been added to the value of\\r\\n         household assets since the end of 1994.  Probably only a few\\r\\n         percent of these largely unrealized capital gains have been\\r\\n         transformed into the purchase of goods and services in\\r\\n         consumer markets.  But that increment to spending, combined\\r\\n         with the sharp increase in equipment investment, which has\\r\\n         stemmed from the low cost of both equity and debt relative to\\r\\n         expected profits on capital, has been instrumental in propelling\\r\\n         the economy forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n              The consequences for the American worker have been\\r\\n         dramatic and, for the most part, highly favorable.  A great\\r\\n         many chronically underemployed people have been given the\\r\\n         opportunity to work, and many others have been able to\\r\\n         upgrade their skills as a result of work experience, extensive\\r\\n         increases in on-the-job training, or increased enrollment in\\r\\n         technical programs in community colleges and elsewhere.  In\\r\\n         addition, former welfare recipients appear to have been\\r\\n         absorbed into the work force in significant numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Government finances have been enhanced as well.\\r\\n         Widespread improvement has been evident in the financial\\r\\n         positions of state and local governments.  In the federal\\r\\n         sector, the taxes paid on huge realized capital gains and other\\r\\n         incomes related to stock market advances, coupled with taxes on\\r\\n         markedly higher corporate profits, have joined with restraint\\r\\n         on spending to produce a unified budget surplus for the first\\r\\n         time in nearly three decades.  The important steps taken by the\\r\\n         Congress and the Administration to put federal finances on a\\r\\n         sounder footing have added to national saving, relieving\\r\\n         pressures on credit markets.  The paydown of debt associated\\r\\n         with the federal surplus has helped to hold down longer-term\\r\\n         interest rates, which in turn has encouraged capital formation\\r\\n         and reduced debt burdens.  Maintaining this disciplined budget\\r\\n         stance would be most helpful in supporting a continuation of\\r\\n         our current robust economic performance in the years ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n              The fact that economic performance has strengthened\\r\\n         as inflation subsided should not have been surprising, given\\r\\n         that risk premiums and economic disincentives to invest in\\r\\n         productive capital diminish as the economy approaches price\\r\\n         stability.  But the extent to which strong growth and high labor\\r\\n         force utilization have been joined with low inflation over an\\r\\n         extended period is, nevertheless, exceptional.  So far, at\\r\\n         least, the adverse wage-price interactions that played so\\r\\n         central a role in pressuring inflation higher in many past\\r\\n         business expansions--eventually bringing those expansions to an\\r\\n         end--have not played a significant role in the current\\r\\n         expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n              For one thing, increases in hourly compensation have\\r\\n         been slower to pick up than in most other recent expansions,\\r\\n         although, to be sure, wages have started to accelerate in the\\r\\n         past couple of years as the labor market has become\\r\\n         progressively tighter.  In the first few years of the expansion,\\r\\n         the subdued rate of rise in hourly compensation seemed to be,\\r\\n         in part, a reflection of greater concerns among workers about\\r\\n         job security.  We now seem to have moved beyond that phase\\r\\n         of especially acute concern, though the flux of technology may\\r\\n         still be leaving many workers with fears of job skill\\r\\n         obsolescence and a willingness to trade wage gains for job\\r\\n         security.  In the past couple of years, of course, workers have\\r\\n         not had to press especially hard for nominal pay gains to\\r\\n         realize sizable increases in their real wages.  In contrast to\\r\\n         the pattern that developed in several previous business\\r\\n         expansions, when workers required substantial increases in pay\\r\\n         just to cover increases in the cost of living, consumer prices\\r\\n         have been generally well-behaved in the current expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n              A couple of years ago--almost at the same time that\\r\\n         increases in total hourly compensation began trending up in\\r\\n         nominal terms--evidence of a long-awaited pickup in the\\r\\n         growth of labor productivity began to show through more\\r\\n         strongly in the data; and this accelerated increase in output\\r\\n         per hour has enabled firms to raise workers' real wages  while\\r\\n         holding the line on price increases.  Gains in productivity\\r\\n         usually vary with the strength of the economy, and the\\r\\n         favorable results that we have observed during the past two\\r\\n         years or so, when the economy has been growing more rapidly,\\r\\n         almost certainly overstate the degree of structural\\r\\n         improvement.  But evidence continues to mount that the trend\\r\\n         of productivity has accelerated, even if the extent of that\\r\\n         pickup is as yet unclear.  Signs of major technological\\r\\n         improvements are all around us, and the benefits are evident\\r\\n         not only in high-tech industries but also in production\\r\\n         processes that have long been part of our industrial economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Those technological innovations and the rapidly\\r\\n         declining cost of capital equipment that embodies them in turn\\r\\n         seem to be a major factor behind the recent enlarged gains in\\r\\n         productivity.  Evidently, plant managers who were involved in\\r\\n         planning capital investments anticipated that a significant\\r\\n         increase in the real rates of return on facilities could be\\r\\n         achieved by exploiting emerging new technologies.  If that had\\r\\n         been a mistake on their part, one would have expected capital\\r\\n         investment to run up briefly and then start down again when\\r\\n         the lower-than-anticipated rates of return developed.  But we\\r\\n         have instead seen sustained gains in investment, indicating that\\r\\n         hoped-for rates of return apparently have been realized.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Notwithstanding a reasonably optimistic interpretation\\r\\n         of the recent productivity numbers, it would not be prudent to\\r\\n         assume that even strongly rising productivity, by itself, can\\r\\n         ensure a non-inflationary future.  Certainly wage increases, per\\r\\n         se, are not inflationary, unless they exceed productivity\\r\\n         growth, thereby creating pressure for inflationary price\\r\\n         increases that can eventually undermine economic growth and\\r\\n         employment.  Because the level of productivity is tied to an\\r\\n         important degree to the stock of capital, which turns over only\\r\\n         gradually, increases in the trend growth of productivity\\r\\n         probably also occur rather gradually.  By contrast, the\\r\\n         potential for abrupt acceleration of nominal hourly compensation\\r\\n         is surely greater.\\r\\n\\r\\n              As I have noted in previous appearances before\\r\\n         Congress, economic growth at rates experienced on average\\r\\n         over the past several years would eventually run into\\r\\n         constraints as the reservoir of unemployed people available to\\r\\n         work is drawn down.  The annual increase in the working-age\\r\\n         population (from 16 to 64 years of age), including immigrants,\\r\\n         has been approximately 1 percent a year in recent years.  Yet\\r\\n         employment, measured by the count of persons who are\\r\\n         working rather than by the count of jobs, has been rising 2\\r\\n         percent a year since 1995, despite the acceleration in the\\r\\n         growth of output per hour.  The gap between employment\\r\\n         growth and population growth, amounting to about 1.1 million\\r\\n         persons a year on average since the end of 1995, has been\\r\\n         made up, in part, by a decline in the number of individuals\\r\\n         who are counted as unemployed--those persons who are\\r\\n         actively seeking work--of approximately 650,000 a year, on\\r\\n         average, over the past two and one-half years.  The remainder\\r\\n         of the gap has reflected a rise in labor force participation\\r\\n         that can be traced largely to a decline of almost 300,000 a year\\r\\n         in the number of individuals (aged 16 to 64) wanting a job but\\r\\n         not actively seeking one.  Presumably, many of the persons\\r\\n         who once were in this group have more recently become active\\r\\n         and successful job-seekers as the economy has strengthened,\\r\\n         thereby preventing a still sharper drop in the official\\r\\n         unemployment rate.  In June, the number of persons aged 16 to\\r\\n         64 who wanted to work but who did not have jobs was 10.6\\r\\n         million on a seasonally adjusted basis, roughly 6 percent of the\\r\\n         working-age population.  Despite an uptick in joblessness in\\r\\n         June, this percentage is only fractionally above the record low\\r\\n         reached in May for these data, which can be calculated back to\\r\\n         1970.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Nonetheless, a strong signal of inflation pressures\\r\\n         building because of compensation increases markedly in\\r\\n         excess of productivity gains has not yet clearly emerged in this\\r\\n         expansion.  Among nonfinancial corporations (our most recent\\r\\n         source of data on consolidated income statements), trends in\\r\\n         costs seem to have accelerated from their lows, but the rates of\\r\\n         increase in both unit labor costs and total unit costs are still\\r\\n         quite low.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Still, the gap between the growth in employment and\\r\\n         that of the working-age population will inevitably close.  What\\r\\n         is crucial to sustaining this unprecedented period of prosperity\\r\\n         is that it close reasonably promptly, given already stretched\\r\\n         labor resources, and that labor markets find a balance\\r\\n         consistent with sustained growth marked by compensation\\r\\n         gains in line with productivity advances.  Whether these\\r\\n         adjustments will occur without monetary policy action remains\\r\\n         an open question.\\r\\n\\nForeign Developments\\n\\r\\n              While the United States has been benefiting from a\\r\\n         virtuous economic cycle, a number of other economies\\r\\n         unfortunately have been spiraling in quite the opposite\\r\\n         direction.  The United States, Canada, and Western Europe\\r\\n         have been enjoying solid economic growth, with relatively low\\r\\n         inflation and declining unemployment, but the economic\\r\\n         performance in many developing and transition nations and\\r\\n         Japan has been deteriorating.  How quickly the latter erosion is\\r\\n         arrested and reversed will be a key factor in shaping U.S.\\r\\n         economic and financial trends in the period ahead.  With all\\r\\n         that is at stake, it would be difficult to overstate how crucial\\r\\n         it is that the authorities in the relevant economies promptly\\r\\n         implement effective policies to correct the structural problems\\r\\n         underlying recent weaknesses and to promote sustainable\\r\\n         economic growth before patterns of reinforcing contraction\\r\\n         become difficult to contain.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Conditions in Asia are of particular concern.\\r\\n         Aggregate output of the Asian developing economies has\\r\\n         plunged, with particularly steep declines in Korea, Malaysia,\\r\\n         Thailand, and Indonesia.  Even the economies of the stalwart\\r\\n         tigers--Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan--have softened.\\r\\n         Economic growth in China has also slowed, owing largely to\\r\\n         the currency depreciations among its neighbors and the sharp\\r\\n         declines in their demand for imports.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Russia has also experienced some spillover from the\\r\\n         Asian difficulties, but Russia's problems are mostly\\r\\n         homegrown.  Large fiscal deficits stem from high effective\\r\\n         marginal tax rates that encourage avoidance and do not raise\\r\\n         adequate revenue.  This and the recent declines in prices of oil\\r\\n         and other commodities have rendered Russian financial\\r\\n         markets and the ruble vulnerable, particularly in an\\r\\n         environment of heightened concern about all emerging\\r\\n         markets.  The Russian government has recently promulgated a\\r\\n         set of new policy measures in connection with an expanded\\r\\n         IMF support package in an effort to address these problems.\\r\\n\\r\\n              In Latin America, conditions vary:  Economies that are\\r\\n         heavily dependent on exports of oil and other commodities\\r\\n         have suffered as prices of those items have fallen, and several\\r\\n         countries in that region have received more intensive scrutiny\\r\\n         in international capital markets, but, on the whole, Latin\\r\\n         American economies continue to perform reasonably well.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Disappointingly, economic activity in Japan--a crucial\\r\\n         engine of Asian economic growth--has turned down after a\\r\\n         long period of subpar growth.  Gross domestic product fell at a\\r\\n         5-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter.  More recently,\\r\\n         confidence of households and businesses has continued to\\r\\n         erode, the sharp contraction elsewhere in Asia has fed back\\r\\n         onto Japan, and the dwindling domestic demand for goods and\\r\\n         services in that country has been further constrained by a\\r\\n         mounting credit crunch.  Nonperforming loans have risen\\r\\n         sharply as real estate values fell following the bursting of the\\r\\n         asset bubble in 1991.  Problems in the banking sector,\\r\\n         exacerbated by the broader Asian financial crisis, have led to\\r\\n         market concerns about the adequacy of the capital of many\\r\\n         Japanese banks and have engendered a premium in the market\\r\\n         for Japanese banks' borrowing.  This resulting squeeze to\\r\\n         profit margins has led to a reluctance to lend in dollars or\\r\\n         yen.  In response to the weakening economy and deteriorating\\r\\n         banking situation, the Japanese yen has tended to weaken\\r\\n         significantly, in often-volatile markets, against the dollar and\\r\\n         major European currencies.\\r\\n\\r\\n              As you know, we have sought to be helpful in the\\r\\n         Japanese government's efforts to stabilize their economy and\\r\\n         financial system, reflecting our awareness of the important role\\r\\n         that Japanese financial and economic performance plays in the\\r\\n         world economy, including that of the United States.  We have\\r\\n         consulted with the relevant Japanese authorities on methods\\r\\n         for resolving difficulties in their banking system and have\\r\\n         urged them to take effective measures to stimulate their\\r\\n         economy.  I believe that the Japanese authorities recognize the\\r\\n         urgency of the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n              That a number of foreign economies are currently\\r\\n         experiencing difficulties is not surprising.  Although many had\\r\\n         previously realized a substantial measure of success in\\r\\n         developing their economies, a number had leaned heavily on\\r\\n         command-type systems rather than relying primarily on market\\r\\n         mechanisms.  This characteristic has been evident not only in\\r\\n         their industrial sectors but in banking where government\\r\\n         intervention is typically heavy, where long-standing personal\\r\\n         and corporate relationships are the predominant factor in\\r\\n         financing arrangements, and where market-based credit\\r\\n         assessments are the exception rather than the rule.  Recent\\r\\n         events confirm that these sorts of structures are ill-suited to\\r\\n         today's dynamic global economy, in which national economies\\r\\n         must be capable of adapting flexibly and rapidly to changing\\r\\n         conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Responses in countries currently experiencing\\r\\n         difficulties have varied considerably.  Some have reacted\\r\\n         quickly and, in general terms, appropriately.  But in others, a\\r\\n         variety of political considerations appear to have militated\\r\\n         against prompt and effective action.\\r\\n\\r\\n              As a consequence, the risks of further adverse\\r\\n         developments in these economies remain substantial.  And\\r\\n         given the pervasive interconnections of virtually all economies\\r\\n         and financial systems in the world today, the associated\\r\\n         uncertainties for the United States and other developed\\r\\n         economies remain substantial as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n              In the current circumstances, we need to be aware that\\r\\n         monetary policy tightening actions in the United States could\\r\\n         have outsized effects on very sensitive financial markets in\\r\\n         Asia, a development that could have substantial adverse\\r\\n         repercussions on U.S. financial markets and, over time, on our\\r\\n         own economy.  But while we must take account of such\\r\\n         foreign interactions, we must be careful that our responses\\r\\n         ultimately are consistent with a monetary policy aimed at\\r\\n         optimal performance of the U.S. economy.  Our objectives\\r\\n         relate to domestic economic performance, and price stability\\r\\n         and maximum sustainable economic growth here at home\\r\\n         would best serve the long-run interests of troubled financial\\r\\n         markets and economies abroad.\\r\\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\n\\r\\n              The Federal Open Market Committee believes that the\\r\\n         conditions for continued growth with low inflation are in place\\r\\n         here in the United States.  As I noted previously, an important\\r\\n         issue for policy is how the imbalance of recent years between\\r\\n         the demand for labor and the growth of the working-age\\r\\n         population is resolved.  In that regard, we see a slowing of\\r\\n         the growth in aggregate demand as a necessary element in the mix.\\r\\n\\r\\n              At this time, some of the key factors that have\\r\\n         supported strong final demand by domestic purchasers remain\\r\\n         favorable.  Although real short-term interest rates have risen\\r\\n         as the federal funds rate has been held unchanged while\\r\\n         inflation expectations have declined, the financial conditions\\r\\n         that have fostered the strength in demand are still in place.\\r\\n         With their incomes and wealth having been on a strong upward\\r\\n         track, American consumers remain quite upbeat.  For businesses,\\r\\n         decreasing costs of and high rates of return on investment, as\\r\\n         well as the scarcity of labor, could keep capital spending\\r\\n         elevated.  These factors suggest some risk that the labor\\r\\n         market could get even tighter.  And even if it does not, under\\r\\n         prevailing tight labor markets increasingly confident workers\\r\\n         might place gradually escalating pressures on wages and costs,\\r\\n         which would eventually feed through to prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n              But a number of factors likely will serve to damp\\r\\n         growth in aggregate demand, helping to foster a reasonably\\r\\n         smooth transition to a more sustainable rate of growth and\\r\\n         reasonable balance in labor markets.  We have yet to see the\\r\\n         full effects of the crisis in East Asia on U.S. employment and\\r\\n         income.  Residential and business fixed investment already\\r\\n         have reached such high levels that further gains approaching\\r\\n         those experienced recently would imply very rapid growth of\\r\\n         the stocks of housing and plant and equipment relative to\\r\\n         income trends.  Moreover, business investment will be damped\\r\\n         if recent indications of a narrowing in domestic operating\\r\\n         profit margins prompt a reassessment of the expected rates of\\r\\n         return on investment in plant and equipment.  Reduced\\r\\n         prospects for the return to capital would not only affect\\r\\n         investment directly but could also affect consumption if stock\\r\\n         prices adjust to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Of course, the demand for labor that is consistent with\\r\\n         a particular rate of output growth also could be lowered if\\r\\n         productivity growth were to increase more.  And, on the supply\\r\\n         side of the labor market, faster growth of the labor force could\\r\\n         emerge as the result of increased immigration or delayed\\r\\n         retirements.  Nonetheless, it appears most probable that the\\r\\n         necessary slower absorption of labor into employment will\\r\\n         reflect, in part, a deceleration of output growth, as a\\r\\n         consequence of evolving market forces.  Failing that, firming\\r\\n         actions on the part of the Federal Reserve may be necessary to\\r\\n         ensure a track of expansion that is capable of being sustained.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Thus, members of the Board of Governors and\\r\\n         presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks anticipate a slowing\\r\\n         in the rate of economic growth.  The central tendency of their\\r\\n         forecasts is that real GDP will rise 3 to 3-1/4 percent over\\r\\n         1998 as a whole and 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 1999.  With the rise\\r\\n         in the demand for workers coming into line with that of the\\r\\n         labor force, the unemployment rate is expected to change little\\r\\n         from its current level, finishing next year in the neighborhood\\r\\n         of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4  percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Inflation performance will be affected by developments\\r\\n         abroad as well as those here at home.  The extent and pace of\\r\\n         recovery of Asian economies currently experiencing a severe\\r\\n         downturn will have important implications for prices of energy\\r\\n         and other commodities, the strength of the dollar, and\\r\\n         competitive conditions on world product markets.  Should the\\r\\n         situation abroad remain unsettled, these factors would\\r\\n         probably continue to contribute to good price performance in\\r\\n         the United States in the period ahead.  But it is important to\\r\\n         recognize that the damping influence of these factors on\\r\\n         inflation is mostly temporary.  At some point, the dollar will\\r\\n         stop rising, foreign demand will begin to recover, and oil and\\r\\n         other commodity prices will stop falling and could even back\\r\\n         up some.  Indeed, a brisk snap-back in foreign economic\\r\\n         activity, should that occur, would add, at least temporarily, to\\r\\n         price pressures in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n              On a more fundamental level, it is the balance of supply\\r\\n         and demand in labor and product markets in the United States\\r\\n         that will have the greatest effect on inflation rates here.  As\\r\\n         I noted previously, wage and benefit costs have been remarkably\\r\\n         subdued in the current expansion.  Nonetheless, an\\r\\n         accelerating trend in wages has been apparent for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n              In addition, a gradual upward tilt in benefit costs has\\r\\n         become evident of late.  A variety of factors--including the\\r\\n         strength of the economy and rising equity values, which have\\r\\n         reduced the need for payments into unemployment trust funds\\r\\n         and pension plans, and the restructuring of the health care\\r\\n         sector--have been working to keep benefit costs in check in\\r\\n         this expansion.  But, in the medical area at least, the most\\r\\n         recent developments suggest that the favorable trend may have\\r\\n         run its course.  The slowing of price increases for medical\\r\\n         services seems to have come to a halt, at least for a time, and,\\r\\n         with the cost-saving shift to managed care having been largely\\r\\n         completed, the potential for businesses to achieve further\\r\\n         savings in that regard appears to be rather limited at this\\r\\n         point.  There have been a few striking instances this past year\\r\\n         of employers boosting outlays for health benefits by substantial\\r\\n         amounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Given that compensation costs are likely to accelerate at\\r\\n         least a little further, productivity trends and profit margins\\r\\n         will be key to determining price performance in the period\\r\\n         ahead.  Whether the recent strong performance of productivity\\r\\n         can be extended remains to be seen.  It does seem likely that\\r\\n         productivity calculated for the entire economy using GDP data\\r\\n         weakened in the second quarter.  This development clearly\\r\\n         owed, at least in some degree, to the deceleration of output in\\r\\n         that period.  In manufacturing, where our data are better\\r\\n         measured, productivity appears still to have registered a solid\\r\\n         increase.  We will be closely monitoring a variety of indicators\\r\\n         to assess how productivity is performing in the months ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Monetary policymakers see the most likely outcome as\\r\\n         modestly higher inflation rates in the next one and one-half\\r\\n         years.  The central tendency of monetary policymakers' CPI\\r\\n         inflation forecasts is for an increase of 1-3/4 to 2 percent\\r\\n         during 1998 and 2 to 2-1/2 percent next year.  As noted, the\\r\\n         ebbing of the special factors reducing inflation over the past\\r\\n         year or so, such as the decline in oil prices, will account for\\r\\n         some of this uptick.  But the Federal Open Market Committee will\\r\\n         need to remain particularly alert to the possibility that more\\r\\n         fundamental imbalances are increasing inflationary pressures.\\r\\n         The Committee would need to resist vigorously any tendency\\r\\n         for an upward trend, which could become embedded in the\\r\\n         inflationary process.\\r\\n\\r\\n              The Committee recognizes that significant risks attend\\r\\n         the outlook:  One is that the impending constraint from\\r\\n         domestic labor markets could bind more abruptly than it has to\\r\\n         date, intensifying inflation pressures.  The other is the\\r\\n         potential for further adverse developments abroad, which could\\r\\n         reduce the demand for U.S. goods and services more sharply than\\r\\n         anticipated and which would thereby ease pressures on labor\\r\\n         markets.  While we expect that the situation will develop\\r\\n         relatively smoothly, the Committee believes that, given the\\r\\n         current tightness in labor markets, the potential for\\r\\n         accelerating inflation is probably greater than the risk of\\r\\n         protracted, excessive weakness in the economy.  In any case, it\\r\\n         will need to continue to monitor evolving circumstances\\r\\n         closely, and adjust the stance of monetary policy as\\r\\n         appropriate, in order to help establish conditions consistent\\r\\n         with progress towards the Federal Reserve's goals of price\\r\\n         stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.\\r\\n\\nRanges for Money and Credit Growth\\n\\r\\n              Indeed, recognition of the benefits of low inflation and\\r\\n         our commitment to the Federal Reserve's statutory objective of\\r\\n         price stability were once again dominant in the Committee's\\r\\n         semiannual review of the ranges for the monetary and debt\\r\\n         aggregates.  The FOMC noted that the behavior of the\\r\\n         monetary aggregates had been somewhat more predictable\\r\\n         over the past few years than it had been earlier in the 1990s.\\r\\n         The rapid growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of the year,\\r\\n         which lifted those measures above the upper ends of the target\\r\\n         ranges established in February, was consistent with the\\r\\n         unexpectedly strong advance in aggregate demand.  However,\\r\\n         movements in velocity remain difficult to predict.\\r\\n\\r\\n              The FOMC will continue to interpret the monetary\\r\\n         ranges as benchmarks for the achievement of price stability\\r\\n         under conditions of historically normal velocity behavior.\\r\\n         Consistent with that interpretation, the Committee decided to\\r\\n         retain the current ranges for the monetary aggregates for 1998,\\r\\n         as well as the range for debt, and to carry them over on a\\r\\n         provisional basis to next year.  Although near-term prospects\\r\\n         for velocity behavior are uncertain, the Committee recognizes\\r\\n         that monetary growth does appear to provide some information\\r\\n         about trends in the economy and inflation.  Therefore, we will\\r\\n         be carefully evaluating the aggregates, relative both to\\r\\n         forecasts and to their ranges, in the context of other readings\\r\\n         on other variables in our efforts to promote optimum\\r\\n         macroeconomic conditions.\\r\\n\\nConcluding Comments\\n\\r\\n              As I have stated in previous testimony, the recent\\r\\n         economic performance, with its combination of strong growth\\r\\n         and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in\\r\\n         my near half-century of daily observation of the American\\r\\n         economy.  Although the reasons for this development are\\r\\n         complex, our success can be attributed in part to sound\\r\\n         economic policy.  The Congress and the Administration have\\r\\n         successfully balanced the budget and, indeed, achieved a\\r\\n         near-term surplus, a development that tends to boost national\\r\\n         saving and investment.  The Federal Reserve has pursued\\r\\n         monetary conditions consistent with maximum sustainable\\r\\n         long-run growth by seeking price stability.  These policies\\r\\n         have helped bring about a healthy macroeconomic\\r\\n         environment for productivity-boosting investment and\\r\\n         innovation, factors that have lifted living standards for most\\r\\n         Americans.  The task before us is to maintain disciplined\\r\\n         economic policies and thereby contribute to maintaining and\\r\\n         extending these gains in the years ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nJuly 1998 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 1998 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 22, 1998, 10:00 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- February 26, 1997\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual monetary policy report\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate \\r\\nFebruary 26, 1997\\n        I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this\\r\\n    Committee to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual\\r\\n    report on monetary policy.\\n\\r\\n        The performance of the U.S. economy over the past\\r\\n    year has been quite favorable.  Real GDP growth picked\\r\\n    up to more than three percent over the four quarters of\\r\\n    1996, as the economy progressed through its sixth year\\r\\n    of expansion.  Employers added more than two-and-a-half\\r\\n    million workers to their payrolls in 1996, and the\\r\\n    unemployment rate fell further.  Nominal wages and\\r\\n    salaries have increased faster than prices, meaning\\r\\n    workers have gained ground in real terms, reflecting\\r\\n    the benefits of rising productivity.  Outside the food\\r\\n    and energy sectors, increases in consumer prices\\r\\n    actually have continued to edge lower, with core CPI\\r\\n    inflation only 2-1/2 percent over the past twelve\\r\\n    months.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Low inflation last year was both a symptom and a\\r\\n    cause of the good economy.  It was symptomatic of the\\r\\n    balance and solidity of the expansion and the evident\\r\\n    absence of major strains on resources.  At the same\\r\\n    time, continued low levels of inflation and inflation\\r\\n    expectations have been a key support for healthy\\r\\n    economic performance.  They have helped to create a\\r\\n    financial and economic environment conducive to strong\\r\\n    capital spending and longer-range planning generally,\\r\\n    and so to sustained economic expansion.  Consequently,\\r\\n    the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes it is\\r\\n    crucial to keep inflation contained in the near term\\r\\n    and ultimately to move toward price stability.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Looking ahead, the members of the FOMC expect\\r\\n    inflation to remain low and the economy to grow\\r\\n    appreciably further.  However, as I shall be\\r\\n    discussing, the unusually good inflation performance of\\r\\n    recent years seems to owe in large part to some\\r\\n    temporary factors, of uncertain longevity.  Thus, the\\r\\n    FOMC continues to see the distribution of inflation\\r\\n    risks skewed to the upside and must remain especially\\r\\n    alert to the possible emergence of imbalances in\\r\\n    financial and product markets that ultimately could\\r\\n    endanger the maintenance of the low-inflation\\r\\n    environment.  Sustainable economic expansion for 1997\\r\\n    and beyond depends on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n        For some, the benign inflation outcome of 1996\\r\\n    might be considered surprising, as resource utilization\\r\\n    rates--particularly of labor--were in the neighborhood\\r\\n    of those that historically have been associated with\\r\\n    building inflation pressures.  To be sure, an\\r\\n    acceleration in nominal labor compensation, especially\\r\\n    its wage component, became evident over the past year.\\r\\n    But the rate of pay increase still was markedly less\\r\\n    than historical relationships with labor market\\r\\n    conditions would have predicted.  Atypical restraint on\\r\\n    compensation increases has been evident for a few years\\r\\n    now and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater\\r\\n    worker insecurity.  In 1991, at the bottom of the\\r\\n    recession, a survey of workers at large firms by\\r\\n    International Survey Research Corporation indicated\\r\\n    that 25 percent feared being laid off.  In 1996,\\r\\n    despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the\\r\\n    tighter labor market, the same survey organization\\r\\n    found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff.\\r\\n\\r\\n        The reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to\\r\\n    seek other employment as the labor market tightened has\\r\\n    provided further evidence of such concern, as has the\\r\\n    tendency toward longer labor union contracts.  For many\\r\\n    decades, contracts rarely exceeded three years.  Today,\\r\\n    one can point to five- and six-year contracts--contracts that are commonly characterized by an\\r\\n    emphasis on job security and that involve only modest\\r\\n    wage increases.  The low level of work stoppages of\\r\\n    recent years also attests to concern about job\\r\\n    security.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Thus, the willingness of workers in recent years\\r\\n    to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job\\r\\n    security seems to be reasonably well documented.  The\\r\\n    unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted\\r\\n    even as the labor market, by all objective measures,\\r\\n    tightened considerably.  One possibility may lie in the\\r\\n    rapid evolution of technologies in use in the work\\r\\n    place.  Technological change almost surely has been an\\r\\n    important impetus behind corporate restructuring and\\r\\n    downsizing.  Also, it contributes to the concern of\\r\\n    workers that their job skills may become inadequate.\\r\\n    No longer can one expect to obtain all of one\\'s\\r\\n    lifetime job skills with a high-school or college\\r\\n    diploma.  Indeed, continuing education is perceived to\\r\\n    be increasingly necessary to retain a job.  The more\\r\\n    pressing need to update job skills is doubtless also a\\r\\n    factor in the marked expansion of on-\\r\\n    the-job training programs, especially in technical\\r\\n    areas, in many of the nation\\'s corporations.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Certainly, other factors have contributed to the\\r\\n    softness in compensation growth in the past few years.\\r\\n    The sharp deceleration in health care costs, of course,\\r\\n    is cited frequently.  Another is the heightened\\r\\n    pressure on firms and their workers in industries that\\r\\n    compete internationally.  Domestic deregulation has had\\r\\n    similar effects on the intensity of competitive forces\\r\\n    in some industries.  In any event, although I do not\\r\\n    doubt that all these factors are relevant, I would be\\r\\n    surprised if they were nearly as important as job\\r\\n    insecurity.\\r\\n\\r\\n        If heightened job insecurity is the most\\r\\n    significant explanation of the break with the past in\\r\\n    recent years, then it is important to recognize that,\\r\\n    as I indicated in last February\\'s Humphrey-Hawkins\\r\\n    testimony, suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence\\r\\n    of job insecurity can be carried only so far.  At some\\r\\n    point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job\\r\\n    security has to come to an end.  In other words, the\\r\\n    relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a\\r\\n    temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because\\r\\n    there is a limit to the value of additional job\\r\\n    security people are willing to acquire in exchange for\\r\\n    lesser increases in living standards.  Even if real\\r\\n    wages were to remain permanently on a lower upward\\r\\n    track than otherwise as a result of the greater sense\\r\\n    of insecurity, the rate of change of wages would revert\\r\\n    at some point to a normal relationship with inflation.\\r\\n    The unknown is when this transition period will end.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Indeed, some recent evidence suggests that the\\r\\n    labor markets bear especially careful watching for\\r\\n    signs that the return to more normal patterns may be in\\r\\n    process.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that\\r\\n    people were somewhat more willing to quit their jobs to\\r\\n    seek other employment in January than previously.  The\\r\\n    possibility that this reflects greater confidence by\\r\\n    workers accords with a recent further rise in the\\r\\n    percent of households responding to a Conference Board\\r\\n    survey who perceive that job availability is plentiful.\\r\\n    Of course, the job market has continued to be quite\\r\\n    good recently; employment in January registered robust\\r\\n    growth and initial claims for unemployment insurance\\r\\n    have been at a relatively low level of late.  Wages\\r\\n    rose faster in 1996 than in 1995 by most measures,\\r\\n    perhaps also raising questions about whether the\\r\\n    transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be\\r\\n    drawing to a close.\\r\\n\\r\\n        To be sure, the pickup in wage gains has not shown\\r\\n    through to underlying price inflation.  Increases in\\r\\n    the core CPI, as well as in several broader measures of\\r\\n    prices, have stayed subdued or even edged off further\\r\\n    in recent months.  As best we can judge, faster\\r\\n    productivity growth last year meant that rising\\r\\n    compensation gains did not cause labor costs per unit\\r\\n    of output to increase any more rapidly.  Non-labor\\r\\n    costs, which are roughly a quarter of total\\r\\n    consolidated costs of the nonfinancial corporate\\r\\n    sector, were little changed in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Owing in part to this subdued behavior of unit\\r\\n    costs, profits and rates of return on capital have\\r\\n    risen to high levels.  As a consequence, businesses\\r\\n    believe that, were they to raise prices to boost\\r\\n    profits further, competitors with already ample profit\\r\\n    margins would not follow suit; instead, they would use\\r\\n    the occasion to capture a greater market share.  This\\r\\n    interplay is doubtless a significant factor in the\\r\\n    evident loss of pricing power in American business.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Intensifying global competition also may be\\r\\n    further restraining domestic firms\\' ability to hike\\r\\n    prices as well as wages.  Clearly, the appreciation of\\r\\n    the dollar on balance over the past eighteen months or\\r\\n    so, together with low inflation in many of our trading\\r\\n    partners, has resulted in a marked decline in non-oil\\r\\n    import prices that has helped to damp domestic\\r\\n    inflation pressures.  Yet it is important to emphasize\\r\\n    that these influences, too, would be holding down\\r\\n    inflation only temporarily; they represent a transition\\r\\n    to a lower price level than would otherwise prevail,\\r\\n    not to a permanently lower rate of inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Against the background of all these considerations,\\r\\n    the FOMC has recognized the need to\\r\\n    remain vigilant for signs of potentially inflationary\\r\\n    imbalances that might, if not corrected promptly,\\r\\n    undermine our economic expansion.  The FOMC in fact has\\r\\n    signaled a state of heightened alert for possible\\r\\n    policy tightening since last July in its policy\\r\\n    directives.  But, we have also taken care not to act\\r\\n    prematurely.  The FOMC refrained from changing policy\\r\\n    last summer, despite expectations of a near-term policy\\r\\n    firming by many financial market participants.  In\\r\\n    light of the developments I\\'ve just discussed affecting\\r\\n    wages and prices, we thought inflation might well\\r\\n    remain damped, and in any case was unlikely to pick up\\r\\n    very rapidly, in part because the economic expansion\\r\\n    appeared likely to slow to a more sustainable pace.  In\\r\\n    the event, inflation has remained quiescent since then.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Given the lags with which monetary policy affects\\r\\n    the economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in\\r\\n    which a preemptive policy tightening may become\\r\\n    appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation\\r\\n    becomes evident.  If the FOMC were to implement such an\\r\\n    action, it would be judging that the risks to the\\r\\n    economic expansion of waiting longer had increased\\r\\n    unduly and had begun to outweigh the advantages of\\r\\n    waiting for uncertainties to be reduced by the\\r\\n    accumulation of more information about economic trends.\\r\\n    Indeed, the hallmark of a successful policy to foster\\r\\n    sustainable economic growth is that inflation does not\\r\\n    rise.  I find it ironic that our actions in 1994-95\\r\\n    were criticized by some because inflation did not turn\\r\\n    upward.  That outcome, of course, was the intent of the\\r\\n    tightening, and I am satisfied that our actions then\\r\\n    were both necessary and effective, and helped to foster\\r\\n    the continued economic expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n        To be sure, 1997 is not 1994.  The real federal\\r\\n    funds rate today is significantly higher than it was\\r\\n    three years ago.  Then we had just completed an\\r\\n    extended period of monetary ease which addressed the\\r\\n    credit stringencies of the early 1990s, and with the\\r\\n    abatement of the credit crunch, the low real funds rate\\r\\n    of early 1994 was clearly incompatible with containing\\r\\n    inflation and sustaining growth going forward.  In\\r\\n    February 1997, in contrast, our concern is a matter of\\r\\n    relative risks rather than of expected outcomes.  The\\r\\n    real funds rate, judging by core inflation, is only\\r\\n    slightly below its early 1995 peak for this cycle and\\r\\n    might be at a level that will promote continued non-\\r\\n    inflationary growth, especially considering the recent\\r\\n    rise in the exchange value of the dollar.  Nonetheless,\\r\\n    we cannot be sure.  And the risks of being wrong are\\r\\n    clearly tilted to the upside.\\r\\n\\r\\n        I wish it were possible to lay out in advance\\r\\n    exactly what conditions have to prevail to portend a\\r\\n    buildup of inflation pressures or inflationary\\r\\n    psychology.  However, the circumstances that have been\\r\\n    associated with increasing inflation in the past have\\r\\n    not followed a single pattern.  The processes have\\r\\n    differed from cycle to cycle, and what may have been a\\r\\n    useful leading indicator in one instance has given off\\r\\n    misleading signals in another.\\r\\n\\r\\n        I have already discussed the key role of labor\\r\\n    market developments in restraining inflation in the\\r\\n    current cycle and our careful monitoring of signs that\\r\\n    the transition phase of trading off lower real wages\\r\\n    for greater job security might be coming to a close.\\r\\n    As always, with resource utilization rates high, we\\r\\n    would need to watch closely a situation in which demand\\r\\n    was clearly unsustainable because it was producing\\r\\n    escalating pressures on resources, which could\\r\\n    destabilize the economy.  And we would need to be\\r\\n    watchful that the progress we have made in keeping\\r\\n    inflation expectations damped was not eroding.  In\\r\\n    general, though, our analysis will need to encompass\\r\\n    all potentially relevant information, from financial\\r\\n    markets as well as the economy, especially when some\\r\\n    signals, like those in the labor market, have not been\\r\\n    following their established patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\n        The ongoing economic expansion to date has\\r\\n    reinforced our conviction about the importance of low\\r\\n    inflation--and the public\\'s confidence in continued low\\r\\n    inflation.  The economic expansion almost surely would\\r\\n    not have lasted nearly so long had monetary policy\\r\\n    supported an unsustainable acceleration of spending\\r\\n    that induced a buildup of inflationary imbalances.  The\\r\\n    Federal Reserve must not acquiesce in an upcreep in\\r\\n    inflation, for acceding to higher inflation would\\r\\n    countenance an insidious weakening of our chances for\\r\\n    sustaining long-run economic growth.  Inflation\\r\\n    interferes with the efficient allocation of resources\\r\\n    by confusing price signals, undercutting a focus on the\\r\\n    longer run, and distorting incentives.\\r\\n\\r\\n        This year overall inflation is anticipated to stay\\r\\n    restrained.  The central tendency of the forecasts made\\r\\n    by the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents has\\r\\n    the increase in the total CPI slipping back into a\\r\\n    range of 2-3/4 to 3 percent over the four quarters of\\r\\n    the year.  This slight falloff from last year\\'s pace is\\r\\n    expected to owe in part to a slower rise in food prices\\r\\n    as some of last year\\'s supply limitations ease.  More\\r\\n    importantly, world oil supplies are projected by most\\r\\n    analysts to increase relative to world oil demand, and\\r\\n    futures markets project a further decline in prices, at\\r\\n    least in the near term.  The recent and prospective\\r\\n    declines in crude oil prices not only should affect\\r\\n    retail gasoline and home heating oil prices but also\\r\\n    should relieve inflation pressures through lower prices\\r\\n    for other petroleum products, which are imbedded in the\\r\\n    economy\\'s underlying cost structure.  Nonetheless, the\\r\\n    trend in inflation rates in the core CPI and in broader\\r\\n    price measures may be somewhat less favorable than in\\r\\n    recent years.  A continued tight labor market, whose\\r\\n    influence on costs would be augmented by the scheduled\\r\\n    increase in the minimum wage later in the year and\\r\\n    perhaps by higher growth of benefits now that\\r\\n    considerable health-care savings already have been\\r\\n    realized, could put upward pressure on core inflation.\\r\\n    Moreover, the effects of the sharp rise in the dollar\\r\\n    over the last eighteen months in pushing down import\\r\\n    prices are likely to ebb over coming quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n        The unemployment rate, according to Board members\\r\\n    and Bank presidents, should stay around 5-1/4 to 5-1/2\\r\\n    percent through the fourth quarter, consistent with\\r\\n    their projections of measured real GDP growth of 2 to\\r\\n    2-1/4 percent over the four quarters of the year.  Such\\r\\n    a growth rate would represent some downshifting in\\r\\n    output expansion from that of last year.  The projected\\r\\n    moderation of growth likely would reflect several\\r\\n    influences: (1) declines in real federal government\\r\\n    purchases should be exerting a modest degree of\\r\\n    restraint on overall demand; (2) the lagged effects of\\r\\n    the increase in the exchange value of the dollar in\\r\\n    recent months likely will damp U.S. net exports\\r\\n    somewhat this year; and (3) residential construction is\\r\\n    unlikely to repeat the gains of 1996.  On the other\\r\\n    hand, we do not see evidence of widespread imbalances\\r\\n    either in business inventories or in stocks of\\r\\n    equipment and consumer durables that would lead to a\\r\\n    substantial cutback in spending.  And financial\\r\\n    conditions overall remain supportive; real interest\\r\\n    rates are not high by historical standards and credit\\r\\n    is readily available from intermediaries and in the\\r\\n    market.\\r\\n\\r\\n        The usual uncertainties in the overall outlook are\\r\\n    especially focused on the behavior of consumers.\\r\\n    Consumption should rise roughly in line with the\\r\\n    projected moderate expansion of disposable income, but\\r\\n    both upside and downside risks are present.  According\\r\\n    to various surveys, sentiment is decidedly upbeat.\\r\\n    Consumers have enjoyed healthy gains in their real\\r\\n    incomes along with the extraordinary stock-market\\r\\n    driven rise in their financial wealth over the last\\r\\n    couple of years.  Indeed, econometric models suggest\\r\\n    that the more than $4 trillion rise in equity values\\r\\n    since late 1994 should have had a larger positive\\r\\n    influence on consumer spending than seems to have\\r\\n    actually occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n        It is possible, however, that households have been\\r\\n    reluctant to spend much of their added wealth because\\r\\n    they see a greater need to keep it to support spending\\r\\n    in retirement.  Many households have expressed\\r\\n    heightened concern about their financial security in\\r\\n    old age, which reportedly has led to increased\\r\\n    provision for retirement.  The results of a survey\\r\\n    conducted annually by the Roper Organization, which\\r\\n    asks individuals about their confidence in the Social\\r\\n    Security system, shows that between 1992 and 1996 the\\r\\n    percent of respondents expressing little or no\\r\\n    confidence in the system jumped from about 45 percent\\r\\n    to more than 60 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Moreover, consumer debt burdens are near\\r\\n    historical highs, while credit card delinquencies and\\r\\n    personal bankruptcies have risen sharply over the past\\r\\n    year.  These circumstances may make both borrowers and\\r\\n    lenders a bit more cautious, damping spending.  In fact,\\r\\n    we may be seeing both wealth and debt effects already at\\r\\n    work for different segments of the population, to an\\r\\n    approximately offsetting extent.  Saving out of current\\r\\n    income by households in the upper income quintile, who\\r\\n    own nearly three-fourths of all non-pension equities\\r\\n    held by households, evidently has declined in recent\\r\\n    years.  At the same time, the use of credit for\\r\\n    purchases appears to have leveled off after a sharp\\r\\n    runup from 1993 to 1996, perhaps because some\\r\\n    households are becoming debt constrained and, as a\\r\\n    result, are curtailing their spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n        The Federal Reserve will be weighing these\\r\\n    influences as it endeavors to help extend the current\\r\\n    period of sustained growth.  Participants in financial\\r\\n    markets seem to believe that in the current benign\\r\\n    environment the FOMC will succeed indefinitely.  There\\r\\n    is no evidence, however, that the business cycle has\\r\\n    been repealed.  Another recession will doubtless occur\\r\\n    some day owing to circumstances that could not be, or\\r\\n    at least were not, perceived by policymakers and\\r\\n    financial market participants alike.  History\\r\\n    demonstrates that participants in financial markets are\\r\\n    susceptible to waves of optimism, which can in turn\\r\\n    foster a general process of asset-price inflation that\\r\\n    can feed through into markets for goods and services.\\r\\n    Excessive optimism sows the seeds of its own reversal\\r\\n    in the form of imbalances that tend to grow over time.\\r\\n    When unwarranted expectations ultimately are not\\r\\n    realized, the unwinding of these financial excesses can\\r\\n    act to amplify a downturn in economic activity, much as\\r\\n    they can amplify the upswing.  As you know, last\\r\\n    December I put the question this way: \"...how do we\\r\\n    know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated\\r\\n    asset values, which then become subject to unexpected\\r\\n    and prolonged contractions ...?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n        We have not been able, as yet, to provide a\\r\\n    satisfying answer to this question, but there are\\r\\n    reasons in the current environment to keep this\\r\\n    question on the table.  Clearly, when people are\\r\\n    exposed to long periods of relative economic\\r\\n    tranquility, they seem inevitably prone to complacency\\r\\n    about the future.  This is understandable.  We have had\\r\\n    fifteen years of economic expansion interrupted by only\\r\\n    one recession--and that was six years ago.  As the\\r\\n    memory of such past events fades, it naturally seems\\r\\n    ever less sensible to keep up one\\'s guard against an\\r\\n    adverse event in the future.  Thus, it should come as\\r\\n    no surprise that, after such a long period of balanced\\r\\n    expansion, risk premiums for advancing funds to businesses\\r\\n    in virtually all financial markets have declined to near-\\r\\n    record lows.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Is it possible that there is something\\r\\n    fundamentally new about this current period that would\\r\\n    warrant such complacency?  Yes, it is possible.\\r\\n    Markets may have become more efficient,  competition is\\r\\n    more global, and information technology has doubtless\\r\\n    enhanced the stability of business operations.  But,\\r\\n    regrettably, history is strewn with visions of such\\r\\n    \"new eras\" that, in the end, have proven to be a\\r\\n    mirage.  In short, history counsels caution.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Such caution seems especially warranted with\\r\\n    regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the\\r\\n    past two years.  These gains have obviously raised\\r\\n    questions of sustainability.  Analytically, current\\r\\n    stock-price valuations at prevailing long-term interest\\r\\n    rates could be justified by very strong earnings growth\\r\\n    expectations.  In fact, the long-term earnings\\r\\n    projections of financial analysts have been marked up\\r\\n    noticeably over the last year and seem to imply very\\r\\n    high earnings growth and continued rising profit\\r\\n    margins, at a time when such margins are already up\\r\\n    appreciably from their depressed levels of five years\\r\\n    ago.  It could be argued that, although margins are the\\r\\n    highest in a generation, they are still below those\\r\\n    that prevailed in the 1960s.  Nonetheless, further\\r\\n    increases in these margins would evidently require\\r\\n    continued restraint on costs: labor compensation\\r\\n    continuing to grow at its current pace and productivity\\r\\n    growth picking up.  Neither, of course, can be ruled\\r\\n    out.  But we should keep in mind that, at these\\r\\n    relatively low long-term interest rates, small changes\\r\\n    in long-term earnings expectations could have outsized\\r\\n    impacts on equity prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Caution also seems warranted by the narrow yield\\r\\n    spreads that suggest perceptions of low risk, possibly\\r\\n    unrealistically low risk.  Considerable optimism about\\r\\n    the ability of businesses to sustain this current\\r\\n    healthy financial condition seems, as I indicated\\r\\n    earlier, to be influencing the setting of risk\\r\\n    premiums, not just in the stock market but throughout\\r\\n    the financial system.  This optimistic attitude has\\r\\n    become especially evident in quality spreads on high-\\r\\n    yield corporate bonds--what we used to call \"junk\\r\\n    bonds.\"  In addition, banks have continued to ease\\r\\n    terms and standards on business loans, and margins on\\r\\n    many of these loans are now quite thin.  Many banks are\\r\\n    pulling back a little from consumer credit card lending\\r\\n    as losses exceed expectations.  Nonetheless, some bank\\r\\n    and nonbank lenders have been expanding aggressively\\r\\n    into the home equity loan market and so-called\\r\\n    \"subprime\" auto lending, although recent problems in\\r\\n    the latter may already be introducing a sense of\\r\\n    caution.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Why should the central bank be concerned about the\\r\\n    possibility that financial markets may be\\r\\n    overestimating returns or mispricing risk?  It is not\\r\\n    that we have a firm view that equity prices are\\r\\n    necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads\\r\\n    patently too low.  Our goal is to contribute as best we\\r\\n    can to the highest possible growth of income and wealth\\r\\n    over time, and we would be pleased if the favorable\\r\\n    economic environment projected in markets actually\\r\\n    comes to pass.  Rather, the FOMC has to be sensitive to\\r\\n    indications of even slowly building imbalances,\\r\\n    whatever their source, that, by fostering the emergence\\r\\n    of inflation pressures, would ultimately threaten\\r\\n    healthy economic expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Unfortunately, because the monetary aggregates\\r\\n    were subject to an episode of aberrant behavioral\\r\\n    patterns in the early 1990s, they are likely to be of\\r\\n    only limited help in making this judgment.  For three\\r\\n    decades starting in the early 1960s, the public\\'s\\r\\n    demand for the broader monetary aggregates, especially\\r\\n    M2, was reasonably predictable.  In the intermediate\\r\\n    term, M2 velocity--nominal income divided by the stock\\r\\n    of M2--tended to vary directly with the difference\\r\\n    between money market yields and the return on M2\\r\\n    assets--that is, with its short-term opportunity cost.\\r\\n    In the long run, as adjustments in deposit rates caused\\r\\n    the opportunity cost to revert to an equilibrium, M2\\r\\n    velocity also tended to return to an associated stable\\r\\n    equilibrium level.  For several years in the early\\r\\n    1990s, however, the velocities of M2 and M3 exhibited\\r\\n    persisting upward shifts that departed markedly from\\r\\n    these historical patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\n        In the last two to three years, velocity patterns\\r\\n    seem to have returned to those historical\\r\\n    relationships, after allowing for a presumed permanent\\r\\n    upward shift in the levels of velocity.  Even so, given\\r\\n    the abnormal velocity behavior during the early 1990s,\\r\\n    FOMC members continue to see considerable uncertainty\\r\\n    in the relationship of broad money to opportunity costs\\r\\n    and nominal income.  Concern about the possibility of\\r\\n    aberrant behavior has made the FOMC hesitant to upgrade\\r\\n    the role of these measures in monetary policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Against this background, at its February meeting,\\r\\n    the FOMC reaffirmed the provisional ranges set last\\r\\n    July for money and debt growth this year:  1 to 5\\r\\n    percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7\\r\\n    percent for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors.\\r\\n    The M2 and M3 ranges again are designed to be consistent \\r\\n    with the FOMC\\'s long-run goal of price stability:\\r\\n    For, if the velocities of the broader monetary\\r\\n    aggregates were to continue behaving as they did before\\r\\n    1990, then money growth around the middle portions of\\r\\n    the ranges would be consistent with noninflationary,\\r\\n    sustainable economic expansion.  But, even with such\\r\\n    velocity behavior this year, when inflation is expected\\r\\n    to still be higher than is consistent with our long-run\\r\\n    objective of reasonable price stability, the broader\\r\\n    aggregates could well grow around the upper bounds of\\r\\n    these ranges.  The debt aggregate probably will expand\\r\\n    around the middle of its range this year.\\r\\n\\r\\n        I will conclude on the same upbeat note about the\\r\\n    U.S. economy with which I began.  Although a central\\r\\n    banker\\'s occupational responsibility is to stay on the\\r\\n    lookout for trouble, even I must admit that our\\r\\n    economic prospects in general are quite favorable.  The\\r\\n    flexibility of our market system and the vibrancy of\\r\\n    our private sector remain examples for the whole world\\r\\n    to emulate.  The Federal Reserve will endeavor to do\\r\\n    its part by continuing to foster a monetary framework\\r\\n    under which our citizens can prosper to the fullest\\r\\n    possible extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nFebruary 1997 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 1997 Testimony\\n\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 21, 1998, 10:15 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- July 22, 1997\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate \\r\\nJuly 22, 1997\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n              I am pleased to appear before this\\r\\n          Subcommittee to present the Federal Reserve's\\r\\n          report on the economic situation and monetary\\r\\n          policy.\\n\\r\\n               The recent performance of the economy,\\r\\n          characterized by strong growth and low\\r\\n          inflation, has been exceptional--and better\\r\\n          than most anticipated.  During the first\\r\\n          quarter of 1997, real gross domestic product\\r\\n          expanded at nearly a 6 percent annual rate,\\r\\n          after posting a 3 percent increase over 1996.\\r\\n          Activity apparently continued to expand in\\r\\n          the second quarter, albeit at a more moderate\\r\\n          pace.  The economy is now in the seventh\\r\\n          consecutive year of expansion, making it the\\r\\n          third longest post-World War II cyclical\\r\\n          upswing to date.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Moreover, our Federal Reserve Banks\\r\\n          indicate that economic activity is on the\\r\\n          rise, and at a relatively high level, in\\r\\n          virtually every geographic region and\\r\\n          community of the nation.  The expansion has\\r\\n          been balanced, in that inventories, as well\\r\\n          as stocks of business capital and other\\r\\n          durable assets, have been kept closely in\\r\\n          line with spending, so overhangs have been\\r\\n          small and readily corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\n               This strong expansion has produced a\\r\\n          remarkable increase in work opportunities for\\r\\n          Americans.  A net of more than thirteen\\r\\n          million jobs has been created since the\\r\\n          current period of growth began in the spring\\r\\n          of 1991.  As a consequence, the unemployment\\r\\n          rate has fallen to 5 percent--its lowest\\r\\n          level in almost a quarter century.  The\\r\\n          expansion has enabled many in the working-age\\r\\n          population, a large number of whom would have\\r\\n          otherwise remained out of the labor force or\\r\\n          among the longer-term unemployed, to acquire\\r\\n          work experience and improved skills.  Our\\r\\n          whole economy will benefit from their greater\\r\\n          productivity.  To be sure, not all segments\\r\\n          of our population are fully sharing in the\\r\\n          economic improvement.  Some Americans still\\r\\n          have trouble finding jobs, and for part of\\r\\n          our work force real wage stagnation persists.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In contrast to the typical postwar\\r\\n          business cycle, measured price inflation is\\r\\n          lower now than when the expansion began and\\r\\n          has shown little tendency to rebound of late,\\r\\n          despite high rates of resource utilization.\\r\\n          In the business sector, producer prices have\\r\\n          fallen in each of the past six months.\\r\\n          Consumers also are enjoying low inflation.\\r\\n          The consumer price index rose at less than a\\r\\n          2 percent annual rate over the first half of\\r\\n          the year, down from a little over 3 percent\\r\\n          in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\n               With the economy performing so well for\\r\\n          so long, financial markets have been buoyant,\\r\\n          as memories of past business and financial\\r\\n          cycles fade with time.  Soaring prices in the\\r\\n          stock market have been fueled by moderate\\r\\n          long-term interest rates and expectations of\\r\\n          investors that profit margins and earnings\\r\\n          growth will hold steady, or even increase\\r\\n          further, in a relatively stable,\\r\\n          low-inflation environment.  Credit spreads at\\r\\n          depository institutions and in the open\\r\\n          market have remained extremely narrow by\\r\\n          historical standards, suggesting a high\\r\\n          degree of confidence among lenders regarding\\r\\n          the prospects for credit repayment.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The key questions facing financial\\r\\n          markets and policymakers are What is behind\\r\\n          the good performance of the economy and Will\\r\\n          it persist.  Without question, the\\r\\n          exceptional economic situation reflects some\\r\\n          temporary factors that have been restraining\\r\\n          inflation rates.  In addition, however,\\r\\n          important pieces of information, while just\\r\\n          suggestive at this point, could be read as\\r\\n          indicating basic improvements in the longer-term efficiency of our economy.  The Federal\\r\\n          Reserve has been aware of this possibility in\\r\\n          our monetary policy deliberations and, as\\r\\n          always, has operated with a view to supplying\\r\\n          adequate liquidity to allow the economy to\\r\\n          reach its highest potential on a sustainable\\r\\n          basis.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Nonetheless, we also recognize that the\\r\\n          capacity of our economy to produce goods and\\r\\n          services is not without limit.  If demand\\r\\n          were to outrun supply, inflationary\\r\\n          imbalances would eventually develop that\\r\\n          would tend to undermine the current expansion\\r\\n          and inhibit the long-run growth potential of\\r\\n          the economy.  Because monetary policy works\\r\\n          with a significant lag, policy actions are\\r\\n          directed at a future that may not be clearly\\r\\n          evident in current experience.  This leads to\\r\\n          policy judgments that are by their nature\\r\\n          calibrated to the relative probabilities of\\r\\n          differing outcomes.  We moved the federal\\r\\n          funds rate higher in March because we\\r\\n          perceived the probability of demand\\r\\n          outstripping supply to have increased to a\\r\\n          point where inaction would have put at risk\\r\\n          the solid elements of support that have\\r\\n          sustained this expansion and made it so\\r\\n          beneficial.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In making such judgments in March and in\\r\\n          the future, we need to analyze carefully the\\r\\n          various forces that may be affecting the\\r\\n          balance of supply and demand in the economy,\\r\\n          including those that may be responsible for\\r\\n          its exceptional recent behavior.  The\\r\\n          remainder of my testimony will address the\\r\\n          various possibilities.\\r\\n\\nInflation, Output, and Technological Change\\r\\n          in the 1990s\\n\\r\\n               Many observers, including us, have been\\r\\n          puzzled about how an economy, operating at\\r\\n          high levels and drawing into employment\\r\\n          increasingly less experienced workers, can\\r\\n          still produce subdued and, by some measures\\r\\n          even falling, inflation rates.  It will,\\r\\n          doubtless, be several years before we know\\r\\n          with any conviction the full story of the\\r\\n          surprisingly benign combination of output and\\r\\n          prices that has marked the business expansion\\r\\n          of the last six years.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Certainly, public policy has played an\\r\\n          important role.  Administration and\\r\\n          Congressional actions to curtail budget\\r\\n          deficits have enabled long-term interest\\r\\n          rates to move lower, encouraging private\\r\\n          efficiency-enhancing capital investment.\\r\\n          Deregulation in a number of industries has\\r\\n          fostered competition and held down prices.\\r\\n          Finally, the preemptive actions of the\\r\\n          Federal Reserve in 1994 contained a\\r\\n          potentially destabilizing surge in demand,\\r\\n          short-circuiting a boom-bust business cycle\\r\\n          in the making and keeping inflation low to\\r\\n          encourage business innovation.  But the\\r\\n          fuller explanation of the recent\\r\\n          extraordinary performance may well lie\\r\\n          deeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In February 1996, I raised before this\\r\\n          Committee a hypothesis tying together\\r\\n          technological change and cost pressures that\\r\\n          could explain what was even then a puzzling\\r\\n          quiescence of inflation.  The new information\\r\\n          received in the last eighteen months remains\\r\\n          consistent with those earlier notions;\\r\\n          indeed, some additional pieces of the puzzle\\r\\n          appear to be falling into place.\\r\\n\\r\\n                A surge in capital investment in high\\r\\n          tech equipment that began in early 1993 has\\r\\n          since strengthened.  Purchases of computer\\r\\n          and telecommunications equipment have risen\\r\\n          at a more than 14 percent annual rate since\\r\\n          early 1993 in nominal terms, and at an\\r\\n          astonishing rate of nearly 25 percent in real\\r\\n          terms, reflecting the fall in the prices of\\r\\n          this equipment.  Presumably companies have\\r\\n          come to perceive a significant increase in\\r\\n          profit opportunities from exploiting the\\r\\n          improved productivity of these new\\r\\n          technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\n               It is premature to judge definitively\\r\\n          whether these business perceptions are the\\r\\n          harbinger of a more general and persistent\\r\\n          improvement in productivity.  Supporting this\\r\\n          possibility, productivity growth, which often\\r\\n          suffers as business expansions mature, has\\r\\n          not followed that pattern.  In addition,\\r\\n          profit margins remain high in the face of\\r\\n          pickups in compensation growth, suggesting\\r\\n          that businesses continue to find new ways to\\r\\n          enhance their efficiency.  Nonetheless,\\r\\n          although the anecdotal evidence is ample and\\r\\n          manufacturing productivity has picked up, a\\r\\n          change in the underlying trend is not yet\\r\\n          reflected in our conventional data for the\\r\\n          whole economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n               But even if the perceived quicker pace\\r\\n          of application of our newer technologies\\r\\n          turns out to be mere wheel-spinning rather\\r\\n          than true productivity advance, it has\\r\\n          brought with it a heightened sense of job\\r\\n          insecurity and, as a consequence, subdued\\r\\n          wage gains.  As I pointed out here last\\r\\n          February, polls indicated that despite the\\r\\n          significant fall in the unemployment rate,\\r\\n          the proportion of workers in larger\\r\\n          establishments fearful of being laid off rose\\r\\n          from 25 percent in 1991 to 46 percent by\\r\\n          1996.  It should not have been surprising\\r\\n          then that strike activity in the 1990s has\\r\\n          been lower than it has been in decades and\\r\\n          that new labor union contracts have been\\r\\n          longer and have given greater emphasis to job\\r\\n          security.  Nor should it have been unexpected\\r\\n          that the number of workers voluntarily\\r\\n          leaving their jobs to seek other employment\\r\\n          has not risen in this period of tight labor\\r\\n          markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n               To be sure, since last year, surveys\\r\\n          have indicated that the proportion of workers\\r\\n          fearful of layoff has stabilized and the\\r\\n          number of voluntary job leavers has edged up.\\r\\n          And, indeed, perhaps as a consequence, wage\\r\\n          gains have accelerated some.  But increases\\r\\n          in the Employment Cost Index still trail\\r\\n          behind what previous relationships to tight\\r\\n          labor markets would have suggested, and a\\r\\n          lingering sense of fear or uncertainty seems\\r\\n          still to pervade the job market, though to a\\r\\n          somewhat lesser extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Consumer surveys do indicate greater\\r\\n          optimism about the economy.  However, it is\\r\\n          one thing to believe that the economy, indeed\\r\\n          the job market, will do well overall, but\\r\\n          quite another to feel secure about one's\\r\\n          individual situation, given the accelerated\\r\\n          pace of corporate restructuring and the\\r\\n          heightened fear of skill obsolescence that\\r\\n          has apparently characterized this expansion.\\r\\n          Persisting insecurity would help explain why\\r\\n          measured personal saving rates have not\\r\\n          declined as would have been expected from the\\r\\n          huge increase in stock market wealth.  We\\r\\n          will, however, have a better fix on savings\\r\\n          rates after the coming benchmark revisions to\\r\\n          the national income and product accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The combination in recent years of\\r\\n          subdued compensation per hour and solid\\r\\n          productivity advances has meant that unit\\r\\n          labor costs of nonfinancial corporations have\\r\\n          barely moved.  Moreover, when you combine\\r\\n          unit labor costs with nonlabor costs -- which\\r\\n          account for one-quarter of total costs on a\\r\\n          consolidated basis -- total unit costs for\\r\\n          the year ended in the first quarter of 1997\\r\\n          rose only about half a percent.  Hence, a\\r\\n          significant part of the measured price\\r\\n          increase over that period was attributable to\\r\\n          a rise in profit margins, unusual well into\\r\\n          a business expansion.  Rising margins are\\r\\n          further evidence suggesting that productivity\\r\\n          gains have been unexpectedly strong; in these\\r\\n          situations, real labor compensation usually\\r\\n          catches up only with a lag.\\r\\n\\r\\n               While accelerated technological change\\r\\n          may well be an important element in\\r\\n          unraveling the current economic puzzle, there\\r\\n          have been other influences at play as well in\\r\\n          restraining price increases at high levels of\\r\\n          resource utilization.  The strong dollar of\\r\\n          the last two years has pared import prices\\r\\n          and constrained the pricing behavior of\\r\\n          domestic firms facing import competition.\\r\\n          Increasing globalization has enabled greater\\r\\n          specialization over a wider array of goods\\r\\n          and services, in effect allowing comparative\\r\\n          advantage to hold down costs and enhance\\r\\n          efficiencies.  Increased deregulation of\\r\\n          telecommunications, motor and rail transport,\\r\\n          utilities, and finance doubtless has been a\\r\\n          factor restraining prices, as perhaps has the\\r\\n          reduced market power of labor unions.\\r\\n          Certainly, changes in the health care\\r\\n          industry and the pricing of health services\\r\\n          have greatly contributed to holding down\\r\\n          growth in the cost of benefits, and hence\\r\\n          overall labor compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Many of these forces are limited or\\r\\n          temporary, and their effects can be expected\\r\\n          to diminish, at which time cost and price\\r\\n          pressures would tend to reemerge. The effects\\r\\n          of an increased rate of technological change\\r\\n          might be more persistent, but they too could\\r\\n          not permanently hold down inflation if the\\r\\n          Federal Reserve allows excess liquidity to\\r\\n          flood financial markets.  I have noted to you\\r\\n          before the likelihood that at some point\\r\\n          workers might no longer be willing to\\r\\n          restrain wage gains for added security, at\\r\\n          which time accelerating unit labor costs\\r\\n          could begin to press on profit margins and\\r\\n          prices, should monetary policy be too\\r\\n          accommodative.\\r\\n\\r\\n               When I discuss greater technological\\r\\n          change, I am not referring primarily to a\\r\\n          particular new invention.  Instead, I have in\\r\\n          mind the increasingly successful and\\r\\n          pervasive application of recent technological\\r\\n          advances, especially in telecommunications\\r\\n          and computers, to enhance efficiencies in\\r\\n          production processes throughout the economy.\\r\\n          Many of these technologies have been around\\r\\n          for some time.  Why might they be having a\\r\\n          more pronounced effect now?\\r\\n\\r\\n               In an intriguing paper prepared for a\\r\\n          conference last year sponsored by the Federal\\r\\n          Reserve Bank of Boston, Professor Nathan\\r\\n          Rosenberg of Stanford documented how, in the\\r\\n          past, it often took a considerable period of\\r\\n          time for the necessary synergies to develop\\r\\n          between different forms of capital and\\r\\n          technologies.  One example is the invention\\r\\n          of the dynamo in the mid 1800s.  Rosenberg's\\r\\n          colleague Professor Paul David had noted a\\r\\n          number of years ago that it wasn't until the\\r\\n          1920s that critical complementary\\r\\n          technologies of the dynamo -- for example,\\r\\n          the electric motor as the primary source of\\r\\n          mechanical drive in factories, and central\\r\\n          generating stations -- were developed and in\\r\\n          place and that production processes had fully\\r\\n          adapted to these inventions.\\r\\n\\r\\n               What we may be observing in the current\\r\\n          environment is a number of key technologies,\\r\\n          some even mature, finally interacting to\\r\\n          create significant new opportunities for\\r\\n          value creation.  For example, the\\r\\n          applications for the laser were modest until\\r\\n          the later development of fiber optics\\r\\n          engendered a revolution in\\r\\n          telecommunications.  Broad advances in\\r\\n          software have enabled us to capitalize on the\\r\\n          prodigious gains in hardware capacity.  The\\r\\n          interaction of both of these has created the\\r\\n          Internet.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The accelerated synergies of the various\\r\\n          technologies may be what have been creating\\r\\n          the apparent significant new profit\\r\\n          opportunities that presumably lie at the root\\r\\n          of the recent boom in high-tech investment.\\r\\n          An expected result of the widespread and\\r\\n          effective application of information and\\r\\n          other technologies would be a significant\\r\\n          increase in productivity and reduction in\\r\\n          business costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n               We do not now know, nor do I suspect can\\r\\n          anyone know, whether current developments are\\r\\n          part of a once or twice in a century\\r\\n          phenomenon that will carry productivity\\r\\n          trends nationally and globally to a new\\r\\n          higher track, or whether we are merely\\r\\n          observing some unusual variations within the\\r\\n          context of an otherwise generally\\r\\n          conventional business cycle expansion.  The\\r\\n          recent improvement in productivity could be\\r\\n          just transitory, an artifact of a temporary\\r\\n          surge in demand and output growth.  In view\\r\\n          of the slowing in growth in the second\\r\\n          quarter and the more moderate expansion\\r\\n          widely expected going forward, data for\\r\\n          profit margins on domestic operations and\\r\\n          productivity from the second quarter on will\\r\\n          be especially relevant in assessing whether\\r\\n          recent improvements are structural or\\r\\n          cyclical.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Whatever the trend in productivity and,\\r\\n          by extension, overall sustainable economic\\r\\n          growth, from the Federal Reserve's point of\\r\\n          view, the faster the better.  We see our job\\r\\n          as fostering the degree of liquidity that\\r\\n          will best support the most effective platform\\r\\n          for growth to flourish.  We believe a\\r\\n          noninflationary environment is such a\\r\\n          platform because it promotes long-term\\r\\n          planning and capital investment and keeps the\\r\\n          pressure on businesses to contain costs and\\r\\n          enhance efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The Federal Reserve's policy problem is\\r\\n          not with growth, but with maintaining an\\r\\n          effective platform.  To do so, we endeavor to\\r\\n          prevent strains from developing in our\\r\\n          economic system, which long experience tells\\r\\n          us produce bottlenecks, shortages, and\\r\\n          inefficiencies.  These eventually create more\\r\\n          inflation, which undermines economic\\r\\n          expansion and limits the longer-term\\r\\n          potential of the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In gauging the potential for oncoming\\r\\n          strains, it is the effective capacity of the\\r\\n          economy to produce that is important to us.\\r\\n          An economy operating at a high level of\\r\\n          utilization and growing 5 percent a year is\\r\\n          in little difficulty if capacity is growing\\r\\n          at least that fast.  But a fully utilized\\r\\n          economy growing at 1 percent will eventually\\r\\n          get into trouble if capacity is growing less\\r\\n          than that.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Capacity itself, however, is a complex\\r\\n          concept, which requires a separate evaluation\\r\\n          of its two components, capital and labor.  It\\r\\n          appears that capital, that is, plant and\\r\\n          equipment, can adapt and expand more\\r\\n          expeditiously than in the past to meet\\r\\n          demands.  Hence, capital capacity is now a\\r\\n          considerably less rigid constraint than it\\r\\n          once was.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In recent years, technology has\\r\\n          engendered a significant compression of lead\\r\\n          times between order and delivery for\\r\\n          production facilities.  This has enabled\\r\\n          output to respond increasingly faster to an\\r\\n          upsurge in demand, thereby decreasing the\\r\\n          incidence of strains on capital capacity and\\r\\n          shortages so evident in earlier business\\r\\n          expansions.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Reflecting progressively shorter lead\\r\\n          times for capital equipment, unfilled orders\\r\\n          to shipment ratios for nondefense capital\\r\\n          goods have declined by 30 percent in the last\\r\\n          six years.  Not only do producers have\\r\\n          quicker access to equipment that embodies the\\r\\n          most recent advances, but they have been able\\r\\n          to adjust their overall capital stock more\\r\\n          rapidly to increases in demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The current lack of material shortages\\r\\n          and bottlenecks, despite the high level and\\r\\n          recent robust expansion of demand, is\\r\\n          striking.  The effective capacity of\\r\\n          production facilities has increased\\r\\n          substantially in recent years in response to\\r\\n          strong final demands and the influence of\\r\\n          cost reductions possible with the newer\\r\\n          technologies.  Increased flexibility is\\r\\n          particularly evident in the computer,\\r\\n          telecommunications, and related industries, a\\r\\n          segment of our economy that seems far less\\r\\n          subject to physical capacity constraints than\\r\\n          many older-line establishments, and one that\\r\\n          is assuming greater importance in our overall\\r\\n          output.  But the shortening of lags has been\\r\\n          pervasive even in more mature industries,\\r\\n          owing in part to the application of advanced\\r\\n          technologies to production methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n               At the extreme, if all capital goods\\r\\n          could be produced at constant cost and on\\r\\n          demand, the size of our nation's capital\\r\\n          stock would never pose a restraint on\\r\\n          production.  We are obviously very far from\\r\\n          that nirvana, but it is important to note\\r\\n          that we are also far from the situation a\\r\\n          half-century ago when our production\\r\\n          processes were dominated by equipment such as\\r\\n          open hearth steel furnaces, which had very\\r\\n          exacting limits on how much they could\\r\\n          produce in a fixed time frame and which\\r\\n          required huge lead times to expand their\\r\\n          capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Even so, today's economy as a whole\\r\\n          still can face capacity constraints from its\\r\\n          facilities.  Indeed, just three years ago,\\r\\n          bottlenecks in industrial production --\\r\\n          though less extensive than in years past at\\r\\n          high levels of measured capacity utilization\\r\\n          -- were nonetheless putting significant\\r\\n          upward pressures on prices at earlier stages\\r\\n          of production.  More recently vendor\\r\\n          performance has deteriorated somewhat,\\r\\n          indicating that flexibility to meet demands\\r\\n          still has limits.  Although further strides\\r\\n          toward greater facilities flexibility have\\r\\n          occurred since 1994, this is clearly an\\r\\n          evolutionary, not a revolutionary, process.\\r\\n\\nLabor Markets\\r\\n\\r\\n               Moreover, technology and management\\r\\n          changes have had only a limited effect on the\\r\\n          ability of labor supply to respond to changes\\r\\n          in demand.  To be sure, individual firms have\\r\\n          acquired additional flexibility by increased\\r\\n          use of outsourcing and temporary workers.  In\\r\\n          addition, smaller work teams can adapt more\\r\\n          readily to variations in order flows.  While\\r\\n          these techniques put the right workers at the\\r\\n          right spots to reduce bottlenecks, they do\\r\\n          not increase the aggregate supply of labor.\\r\\n          That supply is sensitive to changes in\\r\\n          demand, but to a far more limited extent than\\r\\n          for facilities.  New plants can almost always\\r\\n          be built.  But labor capacity for an\\r\\n          individual country is constrained by the size\\r\\n          of the working-age population, which, except\\r\\n          for immigration, is basically determined\\r\\n          several decades in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Of course, capital facilities and labor\\r\\n          are not fully separate markets.  Within\\r\\n          limits, labor and capital are substitutes,\\r\\n          and slack in one market can offset tightness\\r\\n          in another.  For example, additional work\\r\\n          shifts can expand output without significant\\r\\n          addition to facilities, and similarly more\\r\\n          labor-displacing equipment can permit\\r\\n          production to be increased with the same\\r\\n          level of employment.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Yet despite significant increases in\\r\\n          capital equipment in recent years, new\\r\\n          additions to labor supply have been\\r\\n          inadequate to meet the demand for labor.  As\\r\\n          a consequence, the recent period has been one\\r\\n          of significant reduction in labor market\\r\\n          slack.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Of the more than two million net new\\r\\n          hires at an annual rate since early 1994,\\r\\n          only about half have come from an expansion\\r\\n          in the population aged 16 to 64 who wanted a\\r\\n          job, and more than a third of those were net\\r\\n          new immigrants.  The remaining one million\\r\\n          plus per year increase in employment has been\\r\\n          pulled from those who had been reported as\\r\\n          unemployed (600 thousand annually) and those\\r\\n          who wanted, but had not actively sought, a\\r\\n          job (more than 400 thousand annually).  The\\r\\n          latter, of course, are not in the official\\r\\n          unemployment count.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The key point is that continuously\\r\\n          digging ever deeper into the available work\\r\\n          age population is not a sustainable\\r\\n          trajectory for job creation.  The\\r\\n          unemployment rate has a downside limit if for\\r\\n          no other reason than unemployment, in part,\\r\\n          reflects voluntary periods of job search and\\r\\n          other frictional unemployment.  There is also\\r\\n          a limit on how many of the additional 5\\r\\n          million who wanted a job last quarter but\\r\\n          were not actively seeking one could be\\r\\n          readily absorbed into jobs -- in particular,\\r\\n          the large number enrolled in school, and\\r\\n          those who may lack the necessary skills or\\r\\n          face other barriers to taking jobs.  The rise\\r\\n          in the average workweek since early 1996\\r\\n          suggests employers are having increasingly\\r\\n          greater difficulty fitting the millions who\\r\\n          want a job into available job slots.  If the\\r\\n          pace of job creation continues, the pressures\\r\\n          on wages and other costs of hiring increasing\\r\\n          numbers of such individuals could escalate\\r\\n          more rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n               To be sure, there remain an additional\\r\\n          34 million in the working-age population (age\\r\\n          16 - 64) who say they do not want a job.\\r\\n          Presumably, some of these early retirees,\\r\\n          students, or homemakers might be attracted to\\r\\n          the job market if it became sufficiently\\r\\n          rewarding.  However, making it attractive\\r\\n          enough could also involve upward pressures in\\r\\n          real wages that would trigger renewed price\\r\\n          pressures, undermining the expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Thus, there would seem to be emerging\\r\\n          constraints on potential labor input.  Even\\r\\n          before we reach the ultimate limit of\\r\\n          sustainable labor supply growth, the\\r\\n          economy's ability to expand employment at the\\r\\n          recent rate should rapidly diminish.  The\\r\\n          availability of unemployed labor could no\\r\\n          longer add to growth, irrespective of the\\r\\n          degree of slack in physical facilities at\\r\\n          that time.  Simply adding new facilities will\\r\\n          not increase production unless output per\\r\\n          worker improves.  Such improvements are\\r\\n          possible if worker skills increase, but such\\r\\n          gains come slowly through improved education\\r\\n          and on-the-job training.  They are also\\r\\n          possible as capital substitutes for labor,\\r\\n          but are limited by the state of technology.\\r\\n          More significant advances require\\r\\n          technological breakthroughs.  At the cutting\\r\\n          edge of technology, where America finds\\r\\n          itself, major improvements cannot be produced\\r\\n          on demand.  New ideas that matter are hard\\r\\n          won.\\r\\n\\nThe Economic Outlook\\r\\n\\r\\n               As I noted, the recent performance of\\r\\n          the labor markets suggests that the economy\\r\\n          was on an unsustainable track.  Unless\\r\\n          aggregate demand increases more slowly than\\r\\n          it has in recent years -- more in line with\\r\\n          trends in the supply of labor and\\r\\n          productivity -- imbalances will emerge.  We\\r\\n          do not know, however, at what point pressures\\r\\n          would develop -- or indeed whether the\\r\\n          economy is already close to that point.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Fortunately, the very rapid growth of\\r\\n          demand over the winter has eased recently.\\r\\n          To an extent this easing seems to reflect\\r\\n          some falloff in growth of demand for consumer\\r\\n          durables and for inventories to a pace more\\r\\n          in line with moderate expansion in income.\\r\\n          But some of the recent slower growth could\\r\\n          simply be a product of abnormal weather\\r\\n          patterns, which contributed to a\\r\\n          first-quarter surge in output and weakened\\r\\n          the second quarter, in which case the\\r\\n          underlying trend could be somewhat higher\\r\\n          than suggested by the second-quarter data\\r\\n          alone.  Certainly, business and consumer\\r\\n          confidence remains high and financial\\r\\n          conditions are supportive of growth.\\r\\n          Particularly notable is the run-up in stock\\r\\n          market wealth, the full effects of which\\r\\n          apparently have not been reflected in overall\\r\\n          demand, but might yet be.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Monetary policymakers, balancing these\\r\\n          various forces, forecast a continuation of\\r\\n          less rapid growth in coming quarters.  For\\r\\n          1997 as a whole, the central tendency of\\r\\n          their forecasts has real GDP growing 3 to\\r\\n          3-1/4 percent.  This would be much more brisk\\r\\n          than was anticipated in February, and the\\r\\n          upward revision to this estimate largely\\r\\n          reflects the unexpectedly strong first\\r\\n          quarter.  The central tendency of monetary\\r\\n          policymakers' projections is that real GDP\\r\\n          will expand 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 1998.  This\\r\\n          pace of expansion is expected to keep the\\r\\n          unemployment rate close to its current low\\r\\n          level.\\r\\n\\r\\n               We are reasonably confident that\\r\\n          inflation will be quite modest for 1997 as a\\r\\n          whole.  The central tendency of the forecasts\\r\\n          is that consumer prices will rise only 2-1/4\\r\\n          to 2-1/2 percent this year.  This would be a\\r\\n          significantly better outcome than the 2-3/4\\r\\n          to 3 percent CPI inflation foreseen in\\r\\n          February.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Federal Open Market Committee members do\\r\\n          see higher rates of inflation next year.  The\\r\\n          central tendency of the projections is that\\r\\n          CPI inflation will be 2-1/2 to 3 percent in\\r\\n          1998 -- a little above the expectation for\\r\\n          this year.  However, much of this increase is\\r\\n          presumed to result from the absence of\\r\\n          temporary factors that are holding down\\r\\n          inflation this year.  In particular, the\\r\\n          favorable movements in food and energy prices\\r\\n          of 1997 are unlikely to be repeated, and\\r\\n          non-oil import prices may not continue to\\r\\n          decline.  While it is possible that better\\r\\n          productivity trends and subdued wage growth\\r\\n          will continue to help damp the increases in\\r\\n          business costs associated with tight labor\\r\\n          markets, this is a situation that the Federal\\r\\n          Reserve plans to monitor closely.\\r\\n\\r\\n               I have no doubt that the current stance\\r\\n          of policy -- characterized by a nominal\\r\\n          federal funds rate around 5-1/2 percent --\\r\\n          will need to be changed at some point to\\r\\n          foster sustainable growth and low inflation.\\r\\n          Adjustments in the policy instrument in\\r\\n          response to new information are a necessary\\r\\n          and, I should like to emphasize, routine\\r\\n          aspect of responsible policymaking.  For the\\r\\n          present, as I indicated, demand growth does\\r\\n          appear to have moderated, but whether that\\r\\n          moderation will be sufficient to avoid\\r\\n          putting additional pressures on resources is\\r\\n          an open question.  With considerable momentum\\r\\n          behind the expansion and labor market\\r\\n          utilization rates unusually high, the Federal\\r\\n          Reserve must be alert to the possibility that\\r\\n          additional action might be called for to\\r\\n          forestall excessive credit creation.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The Federal Reserve is intent on gearing\\r\\n          its policy to facilitate the maximum\\r\\n          sustainable growth of the economy, but it is\\r\\n          not, as some commentators have suggested,\\r\\n          involved in an experiment that deliberately\\r\\n          prods the economy to see how far and fast it\\r\\n          can grow.  The costs of a failed experiment\\r\\n          would be much too burdensome for too many of\\r\\n          our citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Clearly, in considering issues of\\r\\n          monetary policy we need to distinguish\\r\\n          carefully between sustainable economic growth\\r\\n          and unsustainable accelerations of activity.\\r\\n          Sustainable growth reflects the increased\\r\\n          capacity of the economic system to produce\\r\\n          goods and services over the longer run.  It\\r\\n          is largely the sum of increases in\\r\\n          productivity and in the labor force.  That\\r\\n          growth contrasts with a second type, a more\\r\\n          transitory growth.  An economy producing near\\r\\n          capacity can expand faster for a short time,\\r\\n          often through unsustainably low short-term\\r\\n          interest rates and excess credit creation.\\r\\n          But this is not growth that promotes lasting\\r\\n          increases in standards of living and in jobs\\r\\n          for our nation.  Rather, it is a growth that\\r\\n          creates instability and thereby inhibits the\\r\\n          achievement of our nation's economic goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The key question is how monetary policy\\r\\n          can best foster the highest rate of\\r\\n          sustainable growth and avoid amplifying\\r\\n          swings in output, employment, and prices.\\r\\n          The historical evidence is unambiguous that\\r\\n          excessive creation of credit and liquidity\\r\\n          contributes nothing to the long-run growth of\\r\\n          our productive potential and much to costly\\r\\n          shorter-term fluctuations.  Moreover, it\\r\\n          promotes inflation, impairing the economy's\\r\\n          longer-term potential output.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Our objective has never been to contain\\r\\n          inflation as an end in itself, but rather as\\r\\n          a precondition for the highest possible\\r\\n          long-run growth of output and income -- the\\r\\n          ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In considering possible adjustments of\\r\\n          policy to achieve that goal, the issue of\\r\\n          lags in the effects of monetary policy is\\r\\n          crucial.  The evidence clearly demonstrates\\r\\n          that monetary policy affects the financial\\r\\n          markets immediately but works with\\r\\n          significant lags on output, employment, and\\r\\n          prices.  Thus, as I pointed out earlier,\\r\\n          policy needs to be made today on the basis of\\r\\n          likely economic conditions in the future.  As\\r\\n          a consequence, and in the absence of\\r\\n          once-reliable monetary guides to policy,\\r\\n          there is no alternative to formulating policy\\r\\n          using risk-reward tradeoffs based on what\\r\\n          are, unavoidably, uncertain forecasts.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Operating on uncertain forecasts, of\\r\\n          course, is not unusual.  People do it every\\r\\n          day, consciously or subconsciously.  A driver\\r\\n          might tap the brakes to make sure not to be\\r\\n          hit by a truck coming down the street, even\\r\\n          if he thinks the chances of such an event are\\r\\n          relatively low; the costs of being wrong are\\r\\n          simply too high.  Similarly, in conducting\\r\\n          monetary policy the Federal Reserve needs\\r\\n          constantly to look down the road to gauge the\\r\\n          future risks to the economy and act\\r\\n          accordingly.\\r\\n\\nGrowth of Money and Credit\\r\\n\\r\\n               The view that the Federal Reserve's best\\r\\n          contribution to growth is to foster price\\r\\n          stability has informed both our tactical\\r\\n          decisions on the stance of monetary policy\\r\\n          and our longer-run judgments on appropriate\\r\\n          rates of liquidity provision.  To be sure,\\r\\n          growth rates of monetary and credit\\r\\n          aggregates have become less reliable as\\r\\n          guides for monetary policy as a result of\\r\\n          rapid change in our financial system.  As I\\r\\n          have reported to you previously, the current\\r\\n          uncertainties regarding the behavior of the\\r\\n          monetary aggregates have implied that we have\\r\\n          been unable to employ them as guides to\\r\\n          short-run policy decisions.  Accordingly, in\\r\\n          recent years we have reported annual ranges\\r\\n          for money growth that serve as benchmarks\\r\\n          under conditions of price stability and a\\r\\n          return to historically stable patterns of\\r\\n          velocity.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Over the past several years, the\\r\\n          monetary aggregates -- M2 in particular --\\r\\n          have shown some signs of reestablishing such\\r\\n          stable patterns.  The velocity of M2 has\\r\\n          fluctuated in a relatively narrow range, and\\r\\n          some of its variation within that range has\\r\\n          been explained by interest rate movements, in\\r\\n          a relationship similar to that established\\r\\n          over earlier decades.  We find this an\\r\\n          encouraging development, and it is possible\\r\\n          that at some point the FOMC might elect to\\r\\n          put more weight on such monetary quantities\\r\\n          in the conduct of policy.  But in our view,\\r\\n          sufficient evidence has not yet accumulated\\r\\n          to support such a judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Consequently, we have decided to keep\\r\\n          the existing ranges of growth for money and\\r\\n          credit for 1997 and carry them over to next\\r\\n          year, retaining the interpretation of the\\r\\n          money ranges as benchmarks for the\\r\\n          achievement of price stability.  With nominal\\r\\n          income growth strong relative to the rate\\r\\n          that would likely prevail under conditions of\\r\\n          price stability, the growth of M2 is likely\\r\\n          to run in the upper part of its range both\\r\\n          this year and next, while M3 could run a\\r\\n          little above its cone.  Domestic nonfinancial\\r\\n          sector debt is likely to remain well within\\r\\n          its range, with private debt growth brisk and\\r\\n          federal debt growth subdued.  Although any\\r\\n          tendency for the aggregates to exceed their\\r\\n          ranges would not, in the event, necessarily\\r\\n          call for an examination of whether a policy\\r\\n          adjustment was needed, the Federal Reserve\\r\\n          will be closely examining financial market\\r\\n          prices and flows in the context of a broad\\r\\n          range of economic and price indicators for\\r\\n          evidence that the sustainability of the\\r\\n          economic expansion may be in jeopardy.\\r\\n\\nConcluding Comment\\r\\n\\r\\n               The Federal Reserve recognizes, of\\r\\n          course, that monetary policy does not\\r\\n          determine the economy's potential.  All that\\r\\n          it can do is help establish sound money and a\\r\\n          stable financial environment in which the\\r\\n          inherent vitality of a market economy can\\r\\n          flourish and promote the capital investment\\r\\n          that in the long run is the basis for\\r\\n          vigorous economic growth.  Similarly, other\\r\\n          government policies also have a major role to\\r\\n          play in contributing to economic growth.  A\\r\\n          continued emphasis on market mechanisms\\r\\n          through deregulation will help sharpen\\r\\n          incentives to work, save, invest, and\\r\\n          innovate.  Similarly, a fiscal policy\\r\\n          oriented toward limited growth in government\\r\\n          expenditures, producing smaller budget\\r\\n          deficits and even budget surpluses, would\\r\\n          tend to lower real interest rates even\\r\\n          further, also promoting capital investment.\\r\\n          The recent experience provides striking\\r\\n          evidence of the potential for the\\r\\n          continuation and extension of monetary,\\r\\n          fiscal, and structural policies to enhance\\r\\n          our economy's performance in the period\\r\\n          ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 1997 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 1997 Testimony\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 21, 1998, 10:15 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFRB: Testimony, Greenspan -- Humphrey-Hawkins -- July 18, 1996\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\\nThe Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report\\r\\nBefore the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate \\r\\nJuly 18, 1996\\n\\n\\r\\n     Before I take this opportunity to discuss the performance of the U.S.\\r\\neconomy and the conduct of monetary policy, I would first like to thank the\\r\\nChairman and the other members of this Committee for their support during my\\r\\nconfirmation process.  I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the nation in this\\r\\ncapacity for another term.\\r\\n\\nReview of the First Half of 1996\\n\\r\\n     Nineteen-ninety-six has been a good year for the American economy.  By all\\r\\nindications, spending and production were robust in the first half of this year.  GDP\\r\\nincreased at a 2-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter.  Partial data suggest a\\r\\nsignificantly stronger increase in the second quarter as the economy, as expected,\\r\\naccelerated out of its soft patch around the turn of the year.  During the second\\r\\nquarter, industrial production rose at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent, and\\r\\nmanufacturers are currently running their plant and equipment at utilization rates\\r\\nthat are a touch above their postwar averages.  About 1.4 million workers have been\\r\\nadded to nonfarm payrolls in the first six months of the year, and the\\r\\nunemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in June.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Even though the U.S. economy is using its productive resources intensively,\\r\\ninflation has remained quiescent.  The core inflation rate, measured by the consumer\\r\\nprice index less food and energy prices, at a 2.8 percent annual rate over the first six\\r\\nmonths of the year, is about 1/2 percentage point slower than the same period one\\r\\nyear ago.  While increases in energy prices have boosted the overall CPI inflation\\r\\nrate to 3.5 percent thus far in 1996, a partial reversal of the jump in petroleum\\r\\nproduct prices observed in the first half appears to be in train.  I shall be discussing\\r\\nin greater detail later some possible reasons for this favorable inflation experience\\r\\nand offering some thoughts about how long it might last.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Economic activity thus far this year has turned out to be better than many\\r\\nanalysts expected.  An important supporting factor, as I pointed out in February, was\\r\\nfavorable conditions in financial markets in the latter part of 1995 and early 1996.\\r\\nIntermediate- and longer-term interest rates were low.  Among the influences\\r\\naccounting for this were optimism about prospective budget-deficit reduction, small\\r\\neasings of the stance of monetary policy in the second half of 1995 and early 1996,\\r\\nand the possibility of a further moderation in credit demands owing to a potentially\\r\\nsoft economy.  Credit remained readily available, with banks and other lenders in\\r\\nfinancial markets generally pursuing credit opportunities aggressively.  And a rising\\r\\nstock market reduced the cost of capital to businesses and bolstered household\\r\\nbalance sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Looking forward, there are a number of reasons to expect demands to\\r\\nmoderate and economic activity to settle back toward a more sustainable pace in the\\r\\nmonths ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n     First, the bond markets have taken a turn toward restraint this year as they\\r\\nhave responded to incoming data depicting an economy that was stronger than had\\r\\nbeen anticipated.  Intermediate- and longer-term interest rates have risen from 1 to\\r\\n1-1/4 percentage points since January.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Second, the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets has appreciated\\r\\nsignificantly on a trade-weighted basis against the currencies of other industrial\\r\\ncountries over the past year or so.  This appreciation importantly reflects the market\\r\\nperception that the U.S. economy has been performing better than those of many of\\r\\nour major trading partners.  The rise in the dollar helps to keep down price\\r\\npressures, but it also tends to divert domestic demand toward imported goods and\\r\\ndamp exports some.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Third, the support to economic growth provided by expenditures on durable\\r\\ngoods, both for household consumption and business fixed investment, is likely to\\r\\nwane in coming quarters.  Consumer spending in the past few years has been\\r\\nboosted as households have made up for the purchases of big-ticket items that they\\r\\nhad deferred during the recession and the early, weaker phase of the recovery.  Five\\r\\nyears after the business-cycle trough, however, we should expect that this pent-up\\r\\ndemand has been largely exhausted.  Moreover, many households have built up\\r\\nsizable debt burdens in recent years, and coping with debt repayments could hold\\r\\ndown their spending.  The business sector has been adding considerably to capacity;\\r\\nopportunities to invest profitably in new capital should be increasing less rapidly as\\r\\nfinal demand slows some.\\r\\n\\r\\n     While these are all good reasons to anticipate that economic growth will\\r\\nmoderate some, the timing and extent of that downshift are uncertain.  We have\\r\\nnot, as yet, seen much effect of the rise in interest rates on, for example, the housing\\r\\nmarket.  In many other aspects, financial market conditions remain quite supportive\\r\\nto domestic spending, and the economies of many foreign countries are showing\\r\\nsigns of achieving more solid growth, which should help support our export sales.\\r\\nMoreover, and perhaps of most relevance, a desire to build inventories could add\\r\\nsignificantly to production in the near term.  Data available for 1996 through May\\r\\nshow that inventories were reduced relative to sales and are now fairly lean in many\\r\\nimportant industries.  Although the use of just-in-time inventory and production\\r\\nsystems encourages purchasing managers to keep stocks lean, any evidence that\\r\\ndeliveries of previously ordered goods are being delayed for extended periods would\\r\\nquickly alert companies to the need for higher safety stocks.  Indeed, indications of\\r\\nsome mounting delivery delays in June do raise warning flags in this regard.  The\\r\\nreversal of earlier draw-downs in inventories, of course, could potentially impart an\\r\\nimportant boost to incomes and production as we enter the second half of the year.\\r\\nThe economy is already producing at a high level--and some early signs of pressures\\r\\non resources are emerging, especially in the labor market.\\r\\n\\nThe Recent Behavior of Inflation\\n\\r\\n     There are, to be sure, legitimate questions about how much margin in resource\\r\\nutilization currently exists.  Historically, current levels of slack, measured in terms of\\r\\neither the unemployment rate or capacity utilization, have often been associated\\r\\nwith a gradual strengthening of price and wage pressures.  Yet, the recent evidence of\\r\\nsuch pressures is scant.  I have already noted the lack of a distinct trend in the\\r\\ngrowth rate of the so-called core CPI.  Increases in more comprehensive, and perhaps\\r\\nmore representative, chain-weighted measures of consumer prices, based on the\\r\\nnational income and product accounts, actually have continued to edge lower.  The\\r\\nsame is true of a still broader measure of price change, the chain-weighted price\\r\\nindex for gross domestic purchases, which covers both consumers and businesses.\\r\\nAlthough nominal wage rates have accelerated recently, the rate of increase has been\\r\\nlagging significantly behind that predicted on the basis of historical relationships\\r\\nwith unemployment and past inflation.  And domestic profit margins have held up\\r\\nfar later into this economic expansion than is the norm.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Have we moved into a new environment where inflation imbalances no longer\\r\\nthreaten the stability and growth of our economy in ways they once did?  The\\r\\nsimple answer, in our judgment, is no.  But the issue is not a simple one.\\r\\n\\r\\n     As we have discussed before, powerful forces have evolved in the past few\\r\\nyears to help contain inflationary tendencies.  An ever-increasing share of our\\r\\nnation's workforce uses the tools of new technologies.  Microchips embodied in\\r\\nphysical capital make it work more efficiently, and sophisticated software adds to\\r\\nintellectual capital.  The consequent waves of improvements in production\\r\\ntechniques have quickly altered the economic viability of individual firms and\\r\\nsometimes even entire industries, as well as the market value of workers' skills.\\r\\nWith such fast and changeable currents, it is not surprising that workers may be less\\r\\nwilling to test the waters of job change.  Indeed, voluntary job leaving to seek other\\r\\nemployment appears to be quite subdued despite evidence of a tight labor market.\\r\\nBecause workers are more worried about their own job security and their\\r\\nmarketability if forced to change jobs, they are apparently accepting smaller\\r\\nincreases in their compensation at any given level of labor market tightness.\\r\\nMoreover, a growing share of all output competes in an increasingly global\\r\\nmarketplace, allowing fixed costs to be spread over ever broader markets, promoting\\r\\ngreater specialization and efficiency, and enhancing price competition.\\r\\n\\r\\n     As I indicated in February, these forces, to the extent that they are operative,\\r\\nexert a transitory, not permanent, effect in reducing wage and price inflation.  These\\r\\ntrends leave the level of both wages and prices lower than historical relationships\\r\\nwould predict.  But, at some point, greater job security will no longer be worth the\\r\\nfurther sacrifice of gains in real wages.  The growth of wages will then again be more\\r\\nresponsive to tightness of labor markets, potentially putting pressure on profit\\r\\nmargins and ultimately prices.  Moreover, the reductions in unit costs that are a\\r\\nconsequence of the ever expanding global reach of many companies must ultimately\\r\\nbe bound by the limits of geography.  To be sure, production and sales will continue\\r\\nto be diversified across geographic areas, but the world can only figuratively shrink\\r\\nso far.  At some point, possibly well into the future, increasing returns from ever-\\r\\ngreater globalization must also ebb.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Perhaps reflecting these unusual influences, we have yet to see early signs in\\r\\nprices themselves of intensifying pressures, despite anecdotal and statistical evidence\\r\\nthat the amount of operating slack in our economy has been at low levels by historic\\r\\nstandards for some time.  Among the encouraging indicators, industrial commodity\\r\\nprices have remained roughly flat and the list of reported shortages of materials has\\r\\nbeen exceptionally small.  This pattern is consistent with the view that American\\r\\nbusinesses, by and large, have felt comfortable that inflation has been subdued and\\r\\noffers little evidence of the advance buying and expanded commitments that would\\r\\ncome if businesses were expecting significant price pressures in the reasonably near\\r\\nfuture.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Nonetheless, there are early indications that this episode of favorable inflation\\r\\ndevelopments, especially with regard to labor markets, may be drawing to a close.\\r\\nThe surprising strength in the employment cost index for wages and salaries in the\\r\\nfirst quarter raises the possibility that workers' willingness to surrender wage gains\\r\\nfor job security may be lessening.  Wage data since March have been somewhat\\r\\ndifficult to read.  Average hourly earnings clearly accelerated in the second quarter.\\r\\nHowever, in looking at those figures, one must be mindful that they can reflect not\\r\\nonly changes in wage rates but also shifts in the composition of employment.  And\\r\\nin recent months, a significant part, although not all of the pickup, has been\\r\\naccounted for by a tendency for employment to shift to relatively high-pay\\r\\nindustries, such as durable goods manufacturing.  Whether such shifts also imply a\\r\\ncorrespondingly higher level of output per worker will determine whether unit labor\\r\\ncosts also accelerated to impart upward pressures to price inflation.  Increases in pay,\\r\\nof course, are not inflationary so long as they are matched by gains in productivity.\\r\\nWithout question, we would applaud such trends, which increase standards of living.\\r\\nHowever, wage gains that increase unit costs and are eaten up by inflation help no\\r\\none, and ultimately place economic growth in jeopardy.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Clearly, in this environment, the Federal Reserve has had to become especially\\r\\nvigilant to incipient inflation pressures that could ultimately threaten the health of\\r\\nthe expansion.  The relatively good inflation performance of the past few years, as\\r\\nbest we can judge, owes in part to transitional forces that are only temporarily\\r\\ndamping the wage-price inflation process.  We cannot be confident that we can\\r\\nascertain when that process will come to an end.  This makes policy responses more\\r\\ndifficult than usual, because, as always, the impact of policy will be felt with a\\r\\nsignificant lag.  Of course, if the economy grows so strongly as to strain available\\r\\nresources, transitional forces notwithstanding, history persuasively indicates that\\r\\nimbalances will develop that will bring the expansion to a halt.\\r\\n\\nThe FOMC's Outlook for the Remainder of 1996 and 1997\\n\\r\\n     The forecasts of the governors of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of\\r\\nthe Federal Reserve Banks for economic performance over the remainder of this year\\r\\nand the next reflect the view that sustainable economic growth is likely in store.\\r\\nThe growth rate of real GDP is most commonly seen as between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4\\r\\npercent over the four quarters of 1996 and 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent in 1997.  Given\\r\\nthe strong performance of real GDP in the last two quarters, this outcome implies\\r\\nslower growth in the second half of this year.  Nonetheless, for the remainder of this\\r\\nyear and the next in these projections, the unemployment rate remains in the range\\r\\nof the past 1-1/2 years.  Inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in\\r\\nthe consumer price index, is expected to be 3 to 3-1/4 percent in 1996.  The\\r\\ngovernors and bank presidents, however, view the prospects for inflation to be more\\r\\nfavorable going forward.  The expected reversal of some of the recent run-up in\\r\\nenergy prices would contribute to that result, but policy makers' forecasts also reflect\\r\\ntheir determination to hold the line on inflation.  The central tendency of their\\r\\ninflation forecasts for 1997 is 2-3/4 to 3 percent, returning to the range from 1991\\r\\nto 1995.\\r\\n\\nThe Pursuit of Price Stability\\n\\r\\n     We at the Federal Reserve would welcome faster economic growth, provided\\r\\nthat it were sustainable.  As I emphasized last February, we do not have firm\\r\\njudgments on the specific level or growth rate of output that would engender\\r\\neconomic strains.  Instead, we respond to evidence that those strains themselves are\\r\\ndeveloping.  Whatever the long-run potential for sustainable growth, we believe that\\r\\na necessary condition for achieving it is low inflation.  As a consequence, the Federal\\r\\nReserve remains committed to preventing a sustained pickup in inflation and\\r\\nultimately achieving and preserving price stability.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Price stability is an appropriate and desirable goal for policy, not only because\\r\\nit allows financial markets and the economy to work most efficiently, but also\\r\\nbecause it most likely raises productivity and living standards in the long run.\\r\\nSpecifically, in an inflationary environment, business managers are distracted from\\r\\ntheir basic function of building profits through prudent investment and cost control.\\r\\nMy own observation of business practices over the years suggests that the inability\\r\\nto pass cost increases through to higher prices provides a powerful incentive to firms\\r\\nto increase profit margins through innovation and greater efficiency, which boosts\\r\\nproductivity and ultimately standards of living over time.  Holding the line on\\r\\ninflation, thus, does not impose a speed limit on economic growth.  On the contrary,\\r\\nit induces the private sector to focus more on efforts that yield faster long-term\\r\\neconomic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In this context, we can readily understand why financial markets welcome\\r\\nsustained low inflation.  Uncertainty about future inflation raises the risks associated\\r\\nwith investing for that future.  Lowering that uncertainty by keeping inflation down\\r\\ndiminishes those risks, so that all commitments concerning future income become\\r\\nmore valuable.  During periods of low inflation, stock and bond prices tend to reflect\\r\\nthe higher valuation that comes from harnessing our physical plant more efficiently\\r\\nto provide improved opportunities in the future, including higher wages and profits.\\r\\nWhat investors fear, what all Americans should fear, are inflationary instabilities.\\r\\nThey diminish our ability to provide the wherewithal for the standards of living of\\r\\nthe next generation and the retirement incomes of our current work force.  The\\r\\ninterests of investors as expressed in bond and stock markets do not conflict with\\r\\nthose of average Americans--they coincide.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In order to realize the benefits of low and declining inflation, Federal Reserve\\r\\npolicy has, for some time now, been designed to act preemptively--as I indicated\\r\\nearlier--to look beyond current data readings and base action on its assessment of\\r\\nwhere the economy is headed.  Policy restraint initiated in February 1994 followed\\r\\nfrom the judgment that unchanged policy would encourage subsequent inflationary\\r\\nimbalances that would ultimately cut short the economic expansion.  The three\\r\\neasing steps in the past year were instituted when we anticipated that inflationary\\r\\nimbalances would be less threatening and that lower rates would be compatible with\\r\\npromoting sustainable economic expansion.  Similarly, I am confident that the\\r\\nFederal Open Market Committee would move to tighten reserve market conditions\\r\\nshould the weight of incoming evidence persuasively suggest an oncoming\\r\\nintensification of inflation pressures that would jeopardize the durability of the\\r\\neconomic expansion.\\r\\n\\nThe Ranges for the Debt and Monetary Aggregates\\n\\r\\n     The Committee selected provisional ranges for the monetary aggregates in\\r\\n1997 that once again encompass the growth rates associated with conditions of\\r\\napproximate price stability, provided that these aggregates act in accord with their\\r\\nhistorical relationships with nominal income and interest rates.  These ranges are\\r\\nidentical to those endorsed for 1996--1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for\\r\\nM3.  The Committee reaffirmed its range of 3 to 7 percent for the debt of the\\r\\ndomestic nonfinancial sectors for this year and chose the same range provisionally\\r\\nfor next year.  The Committee's expectations for inflation and nominal GDP\\r\\nexpansion in 1996 and 1997 suggest growth of the monetary aggregates at the upper\\r\\nends of their benchmark ranges as a distinct possibility this year and next, though\\r\\ndebt should be in the middle portion of its range.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The experience of the first part of the 1990s--when money growth diverged\\r\\nfrom historical relationships with income and interest rates--severely set back most\\r\\nanalysts' confidence in the usefulness of M2.  Recently, there have been tentative\\r\\nsigns that the historical relationship linking the velocity of M2--or the ratio of\\r\\nnominal GDP to the money stock--to the cost of holding M2 assets has reasserted\\r\\nitself.  For now, though, the Committee is satisfied with watching these\\r\\ndevelopments carefully, waiting for more compelling evidence that M2 has some\\r\\npredictive content in forecasting current and prospective spending.  Such evidence,\\r\\nhowever, at best will only accumulate gradually over time.\\r\\n\\nBudgetary Policy\\n\\r\\n     Monetary policy is, of course, only one factor shaping the macroeconomic\\r\\nenvironment.  I thus would be remiss if I did not again emphasize the critical\\r\\nimportance to our nation's economic welfare of continuing to reduce our federal\\r\\nbudget deficit.  We have made significant and welcome progress on this score in\\r\\nrecent years.  But unless further legislative steps are taken, that progress will be\\r\\nreversed.  Inevitably, such changes will require addressing the consequences for\\r\\nentitlement spending of the anticipated shift in the nation's demographics in the\\r\\nfirst few decades of the next century.  Lower budget deficits are the surest and most\\r\\ndirect way to increase national saving.  Higher national saving would help to lower\\r\\nreal interest rates, spurring spending on capital goods so as to put cutting-edge\\r\\ntechnology in the hands of more American workers.  With a greater volume of\\r\\nmodern equipment at their disposal, American workers will be able to produce goods\\r\\nthat compete even more effectively on world markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The rally in capital markets last year that trimmed as much as two percentage\\r\\npoints from longer-term Treasury yields was almost surely, in part, a response to the\\r\\ndeveloping positive dialogue on deficit reduction.  While the backup in intermediate-\\r\\nand longer-term market interest rates this year has mostly reflected the unexpected\\r\\nvigor of economic activity, market participants must also have been struck by the\\r\\ndying out of serious discussions that might lead to a bipartisan agreement to\\r\\neliminate the budget deficit over time.\\r\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\r\\n     Mr. Chairman, our economy is now in its sixth year of economic expansion.\\r\\nThe staying power of the expansion has owed importantly to the initial small size\\r\\nand rapid correction of emerging imbalances, reflected in part in the persistence of\\r\\nlow inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n     To be sure, the economy is not free of problems.  But as we address those\\r\\nproblems, policy makers also need to recognize the limitations of our influence and\\r\\nthe wellspring of our success.  The good performance of the American economy in\\r\\nthe most fundamental sense rests on the actions of millions of people, who have\\r\\nbeen given the scope to express themselves in free and open markets.  In this, we are\\r\\na model for the rest of the world, which has come to appreciate the power of market\\r\\neconomies to provide for the public's long-term welfare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nJuly 1996 Humphrey-Hawkins report | 1996 Testimony\\n\\n\\n\\nHome |\\r\\nNews and events |\\r\\nMonetary policy\\nAccessibility | Contact Us\\n\\nLast update: July 21, 1998, 10:15 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]\n"

      "[\"Economic activity expanded at a strong pace over the past year. For 2023 as a whole, gross domestic product increased 3.1 percent, bolstered by solid consumer demand and improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.\\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have continued to come into better balance. Since the middle of last year, payroll job gains have averaged 239,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has remained near historical lows, at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, particularly among individuals aged 25 to 54, and a continued strong pace of immigration. Job vacancies have declined, and nominal wage growth has been easing. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. The strong labor market over the past two years has also helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.1\\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent, a notable slowing from 2022 that was widespread across both goods and services prices. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\", 'After significantly tightening the stance of monetary policy since early 2022, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since its meeting last July. We have also continued to shrink our balance sheet at a brisk pace and in a predictable manner. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.\\nWe believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have seen in inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.']\n"

      "[\"The data from January on employment, consumer spending, manufacturing production, and inflation have partly reversed the softening trends that we had seen in the data just a month ago. Some of this reversal likely reflects the unseasonably warm weather in January in much of the country. Still, the breadth of the reversal along with revisions to the previous quarter suggests that inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\\nFrom a broader perspective, inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year but remains well above the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent. The 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices has slowed from its peak of 7 percent in June to 5.4 percent in January as energy prices have declined and supply chain bottlenecks have eased.\\nOver the past 12 months, core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was 4.7 percent. As supply chain bottlenecks have eased and tighter policy has restrained demand, inflation in the core goods sector has fallen. And while housing services inflation remains too high, the flattening out in rents evident in recently signed leases points to a deceleration in this component of inflation over the year ahead.\\nThat said, there is little sign of disinflation thus far in the category of core services excluding housing, which accounts for more than half of core consumer expenditures. To restore price stability, we will need to see lower inflation in this sector, and there will very likely be some softening in labor market conditions. Although nominal wage gains have slowed somewhat in recent months, they remain above what is consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity. Strong wage growth is good for workers but only if it is not eroded by inflation.\\nTurning to growth, the U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real gross domestic product rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent. Although consumer spending appears to be expanding at a solid pace this quarter, other recent indicators point to subdued growth of spending and production. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent in January, its lowest level since 1969. Job gains remained very strong in January, while the supply of labor has continued to lag.1 As of the end of December, there were 1.9 job openings for each unemployed individual, close to the all-time peak recorded last March, while unemployment insurance claims have remained near historical lows.\", 'With inflation well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and with the labor market remaining extremely tight, the FOMC has continued to tighten the stance of monetary policy, raising interest rates by 4-1/2 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.2\\nWe are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee slowed the pace of interest rate increases over its past two meetings. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.\\nAlthough inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. As I mentioned, the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time.\\nOur overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.']\n"

Although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the first five months of the year, job gains averaged a robust 314,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May, at 3.7 percent. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.1\\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in April, total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) came in at 4.0 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.3 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.', \"With inflation remaining well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and with labor market conditions remaining tight, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points since early last year and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.2 We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.\\nThe economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.3 The extent of these effects remains uncertain.\\nIn light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the FOMC decided last week to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. Nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at last week's meeting, considering how far and how fast we have moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.\\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\\nBefore concluding, let me briefly address the condition of the banking sector. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. As detailed in the box on financial stability in the June Monetary Policy Report, the Federal Reserve, together with the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, took decisive action in March to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system. The recent bank failures, including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and the resulting banking stress have highlighted the importance of ensuring we have the appropriate rules and supervisory practices for banks of this size. We are committed to addressing these vulnerabilities to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system.\\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"]\n"

      "[\"Economic activity expanded at a robust 5 1/2 percent pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year, but with cases having declined sharply since mid-January, the slowdown seems to have been brief.\\nThe labor market is extremely tight. Payroll employment rose by 6.7 million in 2021, and job gains were robust in January. The unemployment rate declined substantially over the past year and stood at 4.0 percent in January, reaching the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has ticked up, labor supply remains subdued. As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, an unprecedented number of workers are quitting to take new jobs, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years.\\nInflation increased sharply last year and is now running well above our longer-run objective of 2 percent. Demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. These supply disruptions have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus, and price increases are now spreading to a broader range of goods and services.\", \"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.\\nThe Committee will continue to monitor incoming economic data and will adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate to manage risks that could impede the attainment of its goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. We continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year as supply constraints ease and demand moderates because of the waning effects of fiscal support and the removal of monetary policy accommodation. But we are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation expectations and inflation itself from a number of factors. We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched while promoting a sustainable expansion and a strong labor market.\\nOur monetary policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. We have phased out our net asset purchases. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month.\\nThe process of removing policy accommodation in current circumstances will involve both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As the FOMC noted in January, the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Reducing our balance sheet will commence after the process of raising interest rates has begun, and will proceed in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments.\\nThe near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.\\nMaintaining the trust and confidence of the public is essential to our work. Last month, the Federal Reserve finalized a comprehensive set of new ethics rules to substantially strengthen the investment restrictions for senior Federal Reserve officials. These new rules will guard against even the appearance of any conflict of interest. They are tough and best in class in government, here and around the world.\\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"]\n"

      "[\"Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE (personal consumption expenditures) prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.9 percent. The available data for May suggest the core measure likely held at that pace or eased slightly last month. Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and fuel and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID-19-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate ongoing supply chain disruptions. Over the past year, inflation also increased rapidly in many foreign economies, as discussed in a box in the June Monetary Policy Report.\\nOverall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent indicators suggest that real gross domestic product growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The tightening in financial conditions that we have seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply.\\nThe labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50‑year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust. Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. A box in the June Monetary Policy Report discusses developments in employment and earnings across all major demographic groups. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January.\", \"The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\\nAgainst the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so. With inflation well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and an extremely tight labor market, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate at each of our past three meetings, resulting in a 1-1/2 percentage point increase in the target range so far this year. The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In May, we announced plans for reducing the size of our balance sheet and, shortly thereafter, began the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. Financial conditions have been tightening since last fall and have now tightened significantly, reflecting both policy actions that we have already taken and anticipated actions.\\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. We will make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\"]\n"

      "['The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in recent months is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation. Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, momentum slowed substantially, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus. In recent weeks, the number of new cases and hospitalizations has been falling, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year. However, the economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain.\\nHousehold spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including leisure and hospitality. In contrast, household spending on goods picked up encouragingly in January after moderating late last year. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to unprecedented fiscal and monetary actions, which have provided essential support to many households, businesses, and communities.\\nAs with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed. Over the three months ending in January, employment rose at an average monthly rate of only 29,000. Continued progress in many industries has been tempered by significant losses in industries such as leisure and hospitality, where the resurgence in the virus and increased social distancing have weighed further on activity. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work. As discussed in the February Monetary Policy Report, the economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers and for African Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.\\nThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices partially rebounded over the rest of last year. However, for some of the sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.\\nWhile we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, developments point to an improved outlook for later this year. In particular, ongoing progress in vaccinations should help speed the return to normal activities. In the meantime, we should continue to follow the advice of health experts to observe social-distancing measures and wear masks.', 'I will now turn to monetary policy. In the second half of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee completed our first-ever public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. We undertook this review because the U.S. economy has changed in ways that matter for monetary policy. The review\\'s purpose was to identify improvements to our policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives. The review involved extensive outreach to a broad range of people and groups through a series of Fed Listens events.\\nAs described in the February Monetary Policy Report, in August, the Committee unanimously adopted its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Our revised statement shares many features with its predecessor. For example, we have not changed our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. However, we did make some key changes. Regarding our employment goal, we emphasize that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, we state that our policy decisions will be informed by our \"assessments of shortfalls of employment from its maximum level\" rather than by \"deviations from its maximum level.\"1 This change means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. Regarding our price-stability goal, we state that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This means that, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. With this change, we aim to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal. Well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation goals, particularly in the current low interest rate environment in which our main policy tool is likely to be more frequently constrained by the lower bound.\\nWe have implemented our new framework by forcefully deploying our policy tools. As noted in our January policy statement, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee\\'s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at their current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward our goals. These purchases, and the associated increase in the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.\\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has been taking actions to support more directly the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) facilities are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place.\\nWe understand that our actions affect households, businesses, and communities across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.']\n"

      "[\"Over the first half of 2021, ongoing vaccinations have led to a reopening of the economy and strong economic growth, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. Real gross domestic product this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by strong fiscal support, accommodative financial conditions, and the reopening of the economy. Housing demand remains very strong, and overall business investment is increasing at a solid pace. As described in the Monetary Policy Report, supply constraints have been restraining activity in some industries, most notably in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production so far this year.\\nConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.\\nAs discussed in the Monetary Policy Report, the pandemic-induced declines in employment last year were largest for workers with lower wages and for African Americans and Hispanics. Despite substantial improvements for all racial and ethnic groups, the hardest-hit groups still have the most ground left to regain.\\nInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy.\\nTo avoid sustained periods of unusually low or high inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) monetary policy framework seeks longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent, the Committee's longer-run inflation objective. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved up from their pandemic lows and are in a range that is broadly consistent with the FOMC's longer-run inflation goal. Two boxes in the July Monetary Policy Report discuss recent developments in inflation and inflation expectations.\\nSustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system, and we continue to monitor vulnerabilities here. While asset valuations have generally risen with improving fundamentals as well as increased investor risk appetite, household balance sheets are, on average, quite strong, business leverage has been declining from high levels, and the institutions at the core of the financial system remain resilient.\", 'I will now turn to monetary policy. At our June meeting, the FOMC kept the federal funds rate near zero and maintained the pace of our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.\\nWe continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee\\'s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. As the Committee reiterated in our June policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. As always, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, we will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal.\\nIn addition, we are continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage‑backed securities at least at their current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. These purchases have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy.\\nAt our June meeting, the Committee discussed the economy\\'s progress toward our goals since we adopted our asset purchase guidance last December. While reaching the standard of \"substantial further progress\" is still a ways off, participants expect that progress will continue. We will continue these discussions in coming meetings. As we have said, we will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases.\\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. The resumption of our Fed Listens initiative will further strengthen our ongoing efforts to learn from a broad range of groups about how they are recovering from the economic hardships brought on by the pandemic. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to support the recovery and foster progress toward our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices.']\n"

      "[\"The economic expansion is well into its 11th year, and it is the longest on record. Over the second half of last year, economic activity increased at a moderate pace and the labor market strengthened further, as the economy appeared resilient to the global headwinds that had intensified last summer. Inflation has been low and stable but has continued to run below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) symmetric 2 percent objective.\\nJob gains averaged 200,000 per month in the second half of last year, and an additional 225,000 jobs were added in January. The pace of job gains has remained above what is needed to provide jobs for new workers entering the labor force, allowing the unemployment rate to move down further over the course of last year. The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent last month and has been near half-century lows for more than a year. Job openings remain plentiful. Employers are increasingly willing to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a result, the benefits of a strong labor market have become more widely shared. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities are finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and levels of education. Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.\\nGross domestic product rose at a moderate rate over the second half of last year. Growth in consumer spending moderated toward the end of the year following earlier strong increases, but the fundamentals supporting household spending remain solid. Residential investment turned up in the second half, but business investment and exports were weak, largely reflecting sluggish growth abroad and trade developments. Those same factors weighed on activity at the nation's factories, whose output declined over the first half of 2019 and has been little changed, on net, since then. The February Monetary Policy Report discusses the recent weakness in manufacturing. Some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, but risks to the outlook remain. In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.\\nInflation ran below the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective throughout 2019. Over the 12 months through December, overall inflation based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also 1.6 percent. Over the next few months, we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent, as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation.\\nThe nation faces important longer-run challenges. Labor force participation by individuals in their prime working years is at its highest rate in more than a decade. However, it remains lower than in most other advanced economies, and there are troubling labor market disparities across racial and ethnic groups and across regions of the country. In addition, although it is encouraging that productivity growth, the main engine for raising wages and living standards over the longer term, has moved up recently, productivity gains have been subpar throughout this economic expansion. Finding ways to boost labor force participation and productivity growth would benefit Americans and should remain a national priority.\", \"I will now turn to monetary policy. Over the second half of 2019, the FOMC shifted to a more accommodative stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from weaker global growth and trade developments and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective. We lowered the federal funds target range at our July, September, and October meetings, bringing the current target range to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. At our subsequent meetings, with some uncertainties surrounding trade having diminished and amid some signs that global growth may be stabilizing, the Committee left the policy rate unchanged. The FOMC believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate. Of course, policy is not on a preset course. If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\\nTaking a longer view, there has been a decline over the past quarter-century in the level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and the economy operating at its full potential. This low interest rate environment may limit the ability of central banks to reduce policy interest rates enough to support the economy during a downturn. With this concern in mind, we have been conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Public engagement is at the heart of this effort. Through our Fed Listens events, we have been hearing from representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. The February Monetary Policy Report shares some of what we have learned. The insights we have gained from these events have informed our framework discussions, as reported in the minutes of our meetings. We will share our conclusions when we finish the review, likely around the middle of the year.\\nThe current low interest rate environment also means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn. A more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy's growth over the long term.\\nFinally, I will briefly review our planned technical operations to implement monetary policy. The February Monetary Policy Report provides details of our operations to date. Last October, the FOMC announced a plan to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations. These actions have been successful in providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effective control of the federal funds rate. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, we intend to gradually transition away from the active use of repo operations. Also, as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow our balance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our liabilities. All of these technical measures support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. They are not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. As always, we stand ready to adjust the details of our technical operations as conditions warrant.\"]\n"

      "[\"Beginning in mid-March, economic activity fell at an unprecedented speed in response to the outbreak of the virus and the measures taken to control its spread. Even after the unexpectedly positive May employment report, nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the reported unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent. The decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) this quarter is likely to be the most severe on record. The burden of the downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans. Instead, those least able to withstand the downturn have been affected most. As discussed in the June Monetary Policy Report, low-income households have experienced, by far, the sharpest drop in employment, while job losses of African Americans, Hispanics, and women have been greater than that of other groups. If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing.\\nRecently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity. With an easing of restrictions on mobility and commerce and the extension of federal loans and grants, some businesses are opening up, while stimulus checks and unemployment benefits are supporting household incomes and spending. As a result, employment moved higher in May. That said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery. Much of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it. Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.\\nMoreover, the longer the downturn lasts, the greater the potential for longer-term damage from permanent job loss and business closures. Long periods of unemployment can erode workers' skills and hurt their future job prospects. Persistent unemployment can also negate the gains made by many disadvantaged Americans during the long expansion and described to us at our Fed Listens events. The pandemic is presenting acute risks to small businesses, as discussed in the Monetary Policy Report. If a small or medium-sized business becomes insolvent because the economy recovers too slowly, we lose more than just that business. These businesses are the heart of our economy and often embody the work of generations.\\nWith weak demand and large price declines for some goods and services—such as apparel, gasoline, air travel, and hotels—consumer price inflation has dropped noticeably in recent months. But indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have been fairly steady. As output stabilizes and the recovery moves ahead, inflation should stabilize and then gradually move back up over time closer to our symmetric 2 percent objective. Inflation is nonetheless likely to remain below our objective for some time.\", \"The Federal Reserve's response to this extraordinary period is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. \\nIn March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, reflecting the effects of COVID-19 on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and the heightened risks to the outlook. We expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\\nWe have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the economy. Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy. As described in the June Monetary Policy Report, these purchases have helped restore orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions. As market functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually reduced the pace of these purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months at least at the current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.\\nTo provide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, established 11 credit and liquidity facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The June Monetary Policy Report provides details on these facilities, which fall into two categories: stabilizing short-term funding markets and providing more-direct support for credit across the economy.\\nTo help stabilize short-term funding markets, the Federal Reserve set up the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Money Market Liquidity Facility to stem rapid outflows from prime money market funds. The Fed also established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, which provides loans against good collateral to primary dealers that are critical intermediaries in short-term funding markets.\\nTo more directly support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve established a number of facilities. To support the small business sector, we established the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to bolster the effectiveness of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act's (CARES Act) Paycheck Protection Program. Our Main Street Lending Program, which we are in the process of launching, supports lending to both small and midsized businesses. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility supports lending to both businesses and consumers. To support the employment and spending of investment-grade businesses, we established two corporate credit facilities. And to help U.S. state and local governments manage cash flow pressures and serve their communities, we set up the Municipal Liquidity Facility.\\nThe tools that the Federal Reserve is using under its 13(3) authority are appropriately reserved for times of emergency. When this crisis is behind us, we will put them away. The June Monetary Policy Report reviews the implications of these tools for the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\\nMany of these facilities have been supported by funding from the CARES Act. We will be disclosing, on a monthly basis, names and details of participants in each such facility; amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and overall costs, revenues, and fees for each facility. We embrace our responsibility to the American people to be as transparent as possible, and we appreciate that the need for transparency is heightened when we are called upon to use our emergency powers.\\nWe recognize that our actions are only part of a broader public-sector response. Congress's passage of the CARES Act was critical in enabling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to establish many of the lending programs. The CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.\\nI want to end by acknowledging the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country. The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation. We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality. I speak for my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say, there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism and there should be no place for it in our society. Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy.\\nWe understand that the work of the Federal Reserve touches communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.\"]\n"

      "[\"The economy grew at a strong pace, on balance, last year, and employment and inflation remain close to the Federal Reserve's statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices‑‑our dual mandate.\\nBased on the available data, we estimate that gross domestic product (GDP) rose a little less than 3 percent last year following a 2.5 percent increase in 2017. Last year's growth was led by strong gains in consumer spending and increases in business investment. Growth was supported by increases in employment and wages, optimism among households and businesses, and fiscal policy actions. In the last couple of months, some data have softened but still point to spending gains this quarter. While the partial government shutdown created significant hardship for government workers and many others, the negative effects on the economy are expected to be fairly modest and to largely unwind over the next several months.\\nThe job market remains strong. Monthly job gains averaged 223,000 in 2018, and payrolls increased an additional 304,000 in January. The unemployment rate stood at 4 percent in January, a very low level by historical standards, and job openings remain abundant. Moreover, the ample availability of job opportunities appears to have encouraged some people to join the workforce and some who otherwise might have left to remain in it. As a result, the labor force participation rate for people in their prime working years‑‑the share of people ages 25 to 54 who are either working or looking for work‑‑has continued to increase over the past year. In another welcome development, we are seeing signs of stronger wage growth.\\nThe job market gains in recent years have benefited a wide range of families and individuals. Indeed, recent wage gains have been strongest for lower-skilled workers. That said, disparities persist across various groups of workers and different parts of the country. For example, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are still well above the jobless rates for whites and Asians. Likewise, the percentage of the population with a job is noticeably lower in rural communities than in urban areas, and that gap has widened over the past decade. The February Monetary Policy Report provides additional information on employment disparities between rural and urban areas.\\nOverall consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is estimated to have been 1.7 percent in December, held down by recent declines in energy prices. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, is estimated at 1.9 percent. At our January meeting, my colleagues and I generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace, albeit somewhat slower than in 2018, and the job market to remain strong. Recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) longer-run goal of 2 percent for a time, but aside from those transitory effects, we expect that inflation will run close to 2 percent.\\nWhile we view current economic conditions as healthy and the economic outlook as favorable, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals. Financial markets became more volatile toward year-end, and financial conditions are now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly China and Europe. And uncertainty is elevated around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations. We will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve.\\nIn addition, our nation faces important longer-run challenges. For example, productivity growth, which is what drives rising real wages and living standards over the longer term, has been too low. Likewise, in contrast to 25 years ago, labor force participation among prime-age men and women is now lower in the United States than in most other advanced economies. Other longer-run trends, such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes, also remain important challenges. And it is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path. As a nation, addressing these pressing issues could contribute greatly to the longer-run health and vitality of the U.S. economy.\", \"Over the second half of 2018, as the labor market kept strengthening and economic activity continued to expand strongly, the FOMC gradually moved interest rates toward levels that are more normal for a healthy economy. Specifically, at our September and December meetings we decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at each, putting the current range at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.\\nAt our December meeting, we stressed that the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook. We also noted that we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the outlook. In January, with inflation pressures muted, the FOMC determined that the cumulative effects of these developments, along with ongoing government policy uncertainty, warranted taking a patient approach with regard to future policy changes. Going forward, our policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and will take into account new information as economic conditions and the outlook evolve.\\nFor guideposts on appropriate policy, the FOMC routinely looks at monetary policy rules that recommend a level for the federal funds rate based on measures of inflation and the cyclical position of the U.S. economy. The February Monetary Policy Report gives an update on monetary policy rules. I continue to find these rules to be helpful benchmarks, but, of course, no simple rule can adequately capture the full range of factors the Committee must assess in conducting policy. We do, however, conduct monetary policy in a systematic manner to promote our long-run goals of maximum employment and stable prices. As part of this approach, we strive to communicate clearly about our monetary policy decisions.\\nWe have also continued to gradually shrink the size of our balance sheet by reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency securities. The Federal Reserve's total assets declined about $310 billion since the middle of last year and currently stand at close to $4.0 trillion. Relative to their peak level in 2014, banks' reserve balances with the Federal Reserve have declined by around $1.2 trillion, a drop of more than 40 percent.\\nIn light of the substantial progress we have made in reducing reserves, and after extensive deliberations, the Committee decided at our January meeting to continue over the longer run to implement policy with our current operating procedure. That is, we will continue to use our administered rates to control the policy rate, with an ample supply of reserves so that active management of reserves is not required. Having made this decision, the Committee can now evaluate the appropriate timing and approach for the end of balance sheet runoff. I would note that we are prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. In the longer run, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities such as currency and bank reserves. The February Monetary Policy Report describes these liabilities and reviews the factors that influence their size over the longer run.\\nI will conclude by mentioning some further progress we have made in improving transparency. Late last year we launched two new publications: The first, Financial Stability Report, shares our assessment of the resilience of the U.S. financial system, and the second, Supervision and Regulation Report, provides information about our activities as a bank supervisor and regulator. Last month we began conducting press conferences after every FOMC meeting instead of every other one. The change will allow me to more fully and more frequently explain the Committee's thinking. Last November we announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive review of the strategies, tools, and communications practices we use to pursue our congressionally assigned goals for monetary policy. This review will include outreach to a broad range of stakeholders across the country. The February Monetary Policy Report provides further discussion of these initiatives.\"]\n"

      "[\"The economy performed reasonably well over the first half of 2019, and the current expansion is now in its 11th year. However, inflation has been running below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) symmetric 2 percent objective, and crosscurrents, such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth, have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook.\\nThe labor market remains healthy. Job gains averaged 172,000 per month from January through June. This number is lower than the average of 223,000 a month last year but above the pace needed to provide jobs for new workers entering the labor force. Consequently, the unemployment rate moved down from 3.9 percent in December to 3.7 percent in June, close to its lowest level in 50 years. Job openings remain plentiful, and employers are increasingly willing to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a result, the benefits of a strong job market have been more widely shared in recent years. Indeed, wage gains have been greater for lower-skilled workers. That said, individuals in some demographic groups and in certain parts of the country continue to face challenges. For example, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics remain well above the rates for whites and Asians. Likewise, the share of the population with a job is higher in urban areas than in rural communities, and this gap widened over the past decade.\", \"Gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 2019, similar to last year's pace. This strong reading was driven largely by net exports and inventories—components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum. The more reliable drivers of growth in the economy are consumer spending and business investment. While growth in consumer spending was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace. However, growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably, and overall growth in the second quarter appears to have moderated. The slowdown in business fixed investment may reflect concerns about trade tensions and slower growth in the global economy. In addition, housing investment and manufacturing output declined in the first quarter and appear to have decreased again in the second quarter.\\nAfter running close to our 2 percent objective over much of last year, overall consumer price inflation, measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), declined earlier this year and stood at 1.5 percent in May. The 12-month change in core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, has also come down this year and was 1.6 percent in May.\\nOur baseline outlook is for economic growth to remain solid, labor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up over time to the Committee's 2 percent objective. However, uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months. In particular, economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies, and that weakness could affect the U.S. economy. Moreover, a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved, including trade developments, the federal debt ceiling, and Brexit. And there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate. We are carefully monitoring these developments, and we will continue to assess their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation.\\nThe nation also continues to confront important longer-run challenges. Labor force participation by those in their prime working years is now lower in the United States than in most other nations with comparable economies. As I mentioned, there are troubling labor market disparities across demographic groups and different parts of the country. The relative stagnation of middle and lower incomes and low levels of upward mobility for lower-income families are also ongoing concerns. In addition, finding ways to boost productivity growth, which leads to rising wages and living standards over the longer term, should remain a high national priority. And I remain concerned about the longer-term effects of high and rising federal debt, which can restrain private investment and, in turn, reduce productivity and overall economic growth. The longer-run vitality of the U.S. economy would benefit from efforts to\", \"the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 2‑1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in the first half of this year. At our January, March, and May meetings, we stated that we would be patient as we determined what future adjustments to the federal funds rate might be appropriate to support our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\\nAt the time of our May meeting, we were mindful of the ongoing crosscurrents from global growth and trade, but there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating. The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China. Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate.\\nSince our May meeting, however, these crosscurrents have reemerged, creating greater uncertainty. Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments. Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed on net, raising concerns that weakness in the global economy will continue to affect the U.S. economy. These concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may have started to show through to incoming data.\\nIn our June meeting statement, we indicated that, in light of increased uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures, we would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Many FOMC participants saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy had strengthened. Since then, based on incoming data and other developments, it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. Inflation pressures remain muted.\\nThe FOMC has made a number of important decisions this year about our framework for implementing monetary policy and our plans for completing the reduction of the Fed's securities holdings. At our January meeting, we decided to continue to implement monetary policy using our current policy regime with ample reserves, and emphasized that we are prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. At our March meeting, we communicated our intention to slow, starting in May, the decline in the Fed's aggregate securities holdings and to end the reduction in these holdings in September.\", \"at monetary policy rules that recommend a level for the federal funds rate based on inflation and unemployment rates. I continue to find these rules helpful, although using these rules requires careful judgment.\\nWe are conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the first review of its kind for the FOMC. Our motivation is to consider ways to improve the Committee's current policy framework and to best position the Fed to achieve maximum employment and price stability.\"]\n"

      "[\"The U.S. economy grew at a solid pace over the second half of 2017 and into this year. Monthly job gains averaged 179,000 from July through December, and payrolls rose an additional 200,000 in January. This pace of job growth was sufficient to push the unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent, about 3/4 percentage point lower than a year earlier and the lowest level since December 2000. In addition, the labor force participation rate remained roughly unchanged, on net, as it has for the past several years--that is a sign of job market strength, given that retiring baby boomers are putting downward pressure on the participation rate. Strong job gains in recent years have led to widespread reductions in unemployment across the income spectrum and for all major demographic groups. For example, the unemployment rate for adults without a high school education has fallen from about 15 percent in 2009 to 5-1/2 percent in January of this year, while the jobless rate for those with a college degree has moved down from 5 percent to 2 percent over the same period. In addition, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are now at or below rates seen before the recession, although they are still significantly above the rate for whites. Wages have continued to grow moderately, with a modest acceleration in some measures, although the extent of the pickup likely has been damped in part by the weak pace of productivity growth in recent years.\\nTurning from the labor market to production, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the second half of 2017, 1 percentage point faster than its pace in the first half of the year. Economic growth in the second half was led by solid gains in consumer spending, supported by rising household incomes and wealth, and upbeat sentiment. In addition, growth in business investment stepped up sharply last year, which should support higher productivity growth in time. The housing market has continued to improve slowly. Economic activity abroad also has been solid in recent quarters, and the associated strengthening in the demand for U.S. exports has provided considerable support to our manufacturing industry.\\nAgainst this backdrop of solid growth and a strong labor market, inflation has been low and stable. In fact, inflation has continued to run below the 2 percent rate that the FOMC judges to be most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in December, about the same as in 2016. The core PCE price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food items and is a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period, somewhat less than in the previous year. We continue to view some of the shortfall in inflation last year as likely reflecting transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat; consistent with this view, the monthly readings were a little higher toward the end of the year than in earlier months.\\nAfter easing substantially during 2017, financial conditions in the United States have reversed some of that easing. At this point, we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. Indeed, the economic outlook remains strong. The robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending, solid economic growth among our trading partners should lead to further gains in U.S. exports, and upbeat business sentiment and strong sales growth will likely continue to boost business investment. Moreover, fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative. In this environment, we anticipate that inflation on a 12-month basis will move up this year and stabilize around the FOMC's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Wages should increase at a faster pace as well. The Committee views the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.\", \"I will now turn to monetary policy. The Congress has assigned us the goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Over the second half of 2017, the FOMC continued to gradually reduce monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at our December meeting, bringing the target to a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. In addition, in October we initiated a balance sheet normalization program to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. That program has been proceeding smoothly. These interest rate and balance sheet actions reflect the Committee's view that gradually reducing monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fostering a return of inflation to 2 percent.\\nIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the FOMC's view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.\\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary policy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our mandated objectives. Personally, I find these rule prescriptions helpful. Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account. I would like to note that this Monetary Policy Report provides further discussion of monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal Reserve's policy process, extending the analysis we introduced in July.\"]\n"

This strong reading was driven largely by net exports and inventories—components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum. The more reliable drivers of growth in the economy are consumer spending and business investment. While growth in consumer spending was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace. However, growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably, and overall growth in the second quarter appears to have moderated. The slowdown in business fixed investment may reflect concerns about trade tensions and slower growth in the global economy. In addition, housing investment and manufacturing output declined in the first quarter and appear to have decreased again in the second quarter.\\nAfter running close to our 2 percent objective over much of last year, overall consumer price inflation, measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), declined earlier this year and stood at 1.5 percent in May. The 12-month change in core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, has also come down this year and was 1.6 percent in May.\\nOur baseline outlook is for economic growth to remain solid, labor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up over time to the Committee's 2 percent objective. However, uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months. In particular, economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies, and that weakness could affect the U.S. economy. Moreover, a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved, including trade developments, the federal debt ceiling, and Brexit. And there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate. We are carefully monitoring these developments, and we will continue to assess their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation.\\nThe nation also continues to confront important longer-run challenges. Labor force participation by those in their prime working years is now lower in the United States than in most other nations with comparable economies. As I mentioned, there are troubling labor market disparities across demographic groups and different parts of the country. The relative stagnation of middle and lower incomes and low levels of upward mobility for lower-income families are also ongoing concerns. In addition, finding ways to boost productivity growth, which leads to rising wages and living standards over the longer term, should remain a high national priority. And I remain concerned about the longer-term effects of high and rising federal debt, which can restrain private investment and, in turn, reduce productivity and overall economic growth. The longer-run vitality of the U.S. economy would benefit from efforts to\", \"the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 2‑1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in the first half of this year. At our January, March, and May meetings, we stated that we would be patient as we determined what future adjustments to the federal funds rate might be appropriate to support our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\\nAt the time of our May meeting, we were mindful of the ongoing crosscurrents from global growth and trade, but there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating. The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China. Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate.\\nSince our May meeting, however, these crosscurrents have reemerged, creating greater uncertainty. Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments. Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed on net, raising concerns that weakness in the global economy will continue to affect the U.S. economy. These concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may have started to show through to incoming data.\\nIn our June meeting statement, we indicated that, in light of increased uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures, we would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Many FOMC participants saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy had strengthened. Since then, based on incoming data and other developments, it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. Inflation pressures remain muted.\\nThe FOMC has made a number of important decisions this year about our framework for implementing monetary policy and our plans for completing the reduction of the Fed's securities holdings. At our January meeting, we decided to continue to implement monetary policy using our current policy regime with ample reserves, and emphasized that we are prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. At our March meeting, we communicated our intention to slow, starting in May, the decline in the Fed's aggregate securities holdings and to end the reduction in these holdings in September.\", \"at monetary policy rules that recommend a level for the federal funds rate based on inflation and unemployment rates. I continue to find these rules helpful, although using these rules requires careful judgment.\\nWe are conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the first review of its kind for the FOMC. Our motivation is to consider ways to improve the Committee's current policy framework and to best position the Fed to achieve maximum employment and price stability.\"]\n"

      "[\"Since my appearance before this Committee last June, the economy has continued to make progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In the labor market, job gains averaged 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016, and the number of jobs rose an additional 227,000 in January. Those gains bring the total increase in employment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million. In addition, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it stood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. A broader measure of labor underutilization, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and people who are working part time but would like a full-time job, has also continued to improve over the past year. In addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years ago, a further indication that the job market is tightening. Importantly, improvements in the labor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment rates for all major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics. Even so, it is discouraging that jobless rates for those minorities remain significantly higher than the rate for the nation overall.\\nOngoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen 1.9 percent last year, the same as in 2015. Consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy pace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households' financial assets and homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates. Last year's sales of automobiles and light trucks were the highest annual total on record. In contrast, business investment was relatively soft for much of last year, though it posted some larger gains toward the end of the year in part reflecting an apparent end to the sharp declines in spending on drilling and mining structures; moreover, business sentiment has noticeably improved in the past few months. In addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have restrained manufacturing output. Meanwhile, housing construction has continued to trend up at only a modest pace in recent quarters. And, while the lean stock of homes for sale and ongoing labor market gains should provide some support to housing construction going forward, the recent increases in mortgage rates may impart some restraint.\\nInflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. Total consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in December, still below the FOMC's 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in 2015. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to about 1-3/4 percent.\\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that U.S. monetary policy remains accommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. Of course, our inflation outlook also depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain reasonably well anchored. It is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter part of 2015 and first half of 2016. Meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months.\\nAs always, considerable uncertainty attends the economic outlook. Among the sources of uncertainty are possible changes in U.S. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity growth, and developments abroad.\", \"Turning to monetary policy, the FOMC is committed to promoting maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Against the backdrop of headwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that emanated from developments abroad, the Committee maintained an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market and an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. At its December meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made toward the FOMC's dual objectives. The Committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds rate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\\nAt its meeting that concluded early this month, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its employment and inflation objectives. As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee's expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\\nThe Committee's view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even keel--will rise somewhat over time. Current estimates of the neutral rate are well below pre-crisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors. The Committee anticipates that the depressing effect of these factors will diminish somewhat over time, raising the neutral funds rate, albeit to levels that are still low by historical standards.\\nThat said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC's monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\\nFinally, the Committee has continued its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.\"]\n"

      "[\"Since my appearance before this committee in February, the labor market has continued to strengthen. Job gains have averaged 180,000 per month so far this year, down only slightly from the average in 2016 and still well above the pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Indeed, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1/4 percentage point since the start of the year, and, at 4.4 percent in June, is 5‑1/2 percentage points below its peak in 2010 and modestly below the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' assessments of its longer-run normal level. The labor force participation rate has changed little, on net, this year--another indication of improving conditions in the jobs market, given the demographically driven downward trend in this series. A broader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the labor force and those working part time who would prefer full-time work has also fallen this year and is now nearly as low as it was just before the recession. It is also encouraging that jobless rates have continued to decline for most major demographic groups, including for African Americans and Hispanics. However, as before the recession, unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall.\\nMeanwhile, the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace, on average, so far this year. Although inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent in the first quarter, more-recent indicators suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter. In particular, growth in household spending, which was weak earlier in the year, has picked up in recent months and continues to be supported by job gains, rising household wealth, and favorable consumer sentiment. In addition, business fixed investment has turned up this year after having been soft last year. And a strengthening in economic growth abroad has provided important support for U.S. manufacturing production and exports. The housing market has continued to recover gradually, aided by the ongoing improvement in the labor market and mortgage rates that, although up somewhat from a year ago, remain at relatively low levels.\\nWith regard to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in May, up from about 1 percent a year ago but a little lower than earlier this year. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has also edged down in recent months and was 1.4 percent in May, a couple of tenths below the year-earlier reading. It appears that the recent lower readings on inflation are partly the result of a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices; these reductions will hold 12-month inflation down until they drop out of the calculation. Nevertheless, with inflation continuing to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, the FOMC indicated in its June statement that it intends to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our symmetric inflation goal.\\nLooking ahead, my colleagues on the FOMC and I expect that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to expand at a moderate pace over the next couple of years, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that monetary policy remains accommodative. Ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and, therefore, consumer spending; global economic growth should support further gains in U.S. exports; and favorable financial conditions, coupled with the prospect of continued gains in domestic and foreign spending and the ongoing recovery in drilling activity, should continue to support business investment. These developments should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.\\nOf course, considerable uncertainty always attends the economic outlook. There is, for example, uncertainty about when--and how much--inflation will respond to tightening resource utilization. Possible changes in fiscal and other government policies here in the United States represent another source of uncertainty. In addition, although the prospects for the global economy appear to have improved somewhat this year, a number of our trading partners continue to confront economic challenges. At present, I see roughly equal odds that the U.S. economy's performance will be somewhat stronger or somewhat less strong than we currently project.\", \"I will now turn to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability, as required by law. Over the first half of 2017, the Committee continued to gradually reduce the amount of monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at both its March and June meetings, bringing the target to a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made--and is expected to continue to make--toward our mandated objectives.\\nThe Committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and stable prices. That expectation is based on our view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level--that is, the level of the federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel. Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance. But because we also anticipate that the factors that are currently holding down the neutral rate will diminish somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion and return inflation to our 2 percent goal. Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.\\nAs I noted earlier, the economic outlook is always subject to considerable uncertainty, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and to their judgments of the associated risks as informed by incoming data. In this regard, as we noted in the FOMC statement last month, inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective and has declined recently; the Committee will be monitoring inflation developments closely in the months ahead.\\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary policy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our mandated objectives. However, such prescriptions cannot be applied in a mechanical way; their use requires careful judgments about the choice and measurement of the inputs into these rules, as well as the implications of the many considerations these rules do not take into account. I would like to note the discussion of simple monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal Reserve's policy process that appears in our current Monetary Policy Report.\\nBalance Sheet Normalization\\r\\nLet me now turn to our balance sheet. Last month the FOMC augmented its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing additional details on the process that we will follow in normalizing the size of our balance sheet. The Committee intends to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments it receives from the securities held in the System Open Market Account. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps. Initially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels to limit the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb. The Committee currently expects that, provided the economy evolves broadly as anticipated, it will likely begin to implement the program this year.\\nOnce we start to reduce our reinvestments, our securities holdings will gradually decline, as will the supply of reserve balances in the banking system. The longer-run normal level of reserve balances will depend on a number of as-yet-unknown factors, including the banking system's future demand for reserves and the Committee's future decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively. The Committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances to a level that is appreciably below recent levels but larger than before the financial crisis.\\nFinally, the Committee affirmed in June that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In other words, we do not intend to use the balance sheet as an active tool for monetary policy in normal times. However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate. More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.\"]\n"

      "[\"Since my appearance before this Committee last July, the economy has made further progress toward the Federal Reserve's objective of maximum employment. And while inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects that inflation will rise to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\\nIn the labor market, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs rose 2.7 million in 2015, and posted a further gain of 150,000 in January of this year. The cumulative increase in employment since its trough in early 2010, is now more than 13 million jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent in January, 0.8 percentage point below its level a year ago and in line with the median of FOMC participants' most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level. Other measures of labor market conditions have also shown solid improvement, with noticeable declines over the past year in the number of individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently, and in the number of people who are working part time but would rather work full time. However, these measures remain above the levels seen prior to the recession, suggesting that some slack in labor markets remains. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, there is still room for further sustainable improvement.\\nThe strong gains in the job market last year were accompanied by a continued moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased about 1-3/4 percent in 2015. Over the course of the year, subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar restrained net exports. In the fourth quarter of last year, growth in the gross domestic product is reported to have slowed more sharply, to an annual rate of just 3/4 percent; again, growth was held back by weak net exports as well as by a negative contribution from inventory investment. Although private domestic final demand appears to have slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, it has continued to advance. Household spending has been supported by steady job gains and solid growth in real disposable income--aided in part by the declines in oil prices. One area of particular strength has been purchases of cars and light trucks; sales of these vehicles in 2015, reached their highest level ever. In the drilling and mining sector, lower oil prices have caused companies to slash jobs and sharply cut capital outlays, but in most other sectors, business investment rose over the second half of last year. And homebuilding activity has continued to move up, on balance, although the level of new construction remains well below the longer-run levels implied by demographic trends.\\nFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. Still, ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the growth of real incomes and therefore consumer spending, and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by highly accommodative monetary policies abroad. Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\\nAs is always the case, the economic outlook is uncertain. Foreign economic developments, in particular, pose risks to U.S. economic growth. Most notably, although recent economic indicators do not suggest a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth, declines in the foreign exchange value of the renminbi have intensified uncertainty about China's exchange rate policy and the prospects for its economy. This uncertainty led to increased volatility in global financial markets and, against the background of persistent weakness abroad, exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth. These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn, low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for U.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.\\nOf course, economic growth could also exceed our projections for a number of reasons, including the possibility that low oil prices will boost U.S. economic growth more than we expect. At present, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments, as well as assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation and the balance of risks to the outlook.\\nAs I noted earlier, inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased just 1/2 percent over the 12 months of 2015. To a large extent, the low average pace of inflation last year can be traced to the earlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of other imported goods. And, given the recent further declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as the further appreciation of the dollar, the Committee expects inflation to remain low in the near term. However, once oil and import prices stop falling, the downward pressure on domestic inflation from those sources should wane, and as the labor market strengthens further, inflation is expected to rise gradually to 2 percent over the medium term. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee is carefully monitoring actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.\\nOf course, inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation process, and the Committee's confidence in the inflation outlook depends importantly on the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored. It is worth noting, in this regard, that market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down to historically low levels; our analysis suggests that changes in risk and liquidity premiums over the past year and a half contributed significantly to these declines. Some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations are also at the low end of their recent ranges; overall, however, they have been reasonably stable.\", ', the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Last March, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. In December, the Committee judged that these two criteria had been satisfied and decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to between 1/4 and 1/2 percent. This increase marked the end of a seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero. The Committee did not adjust the target range in January.\\nThe decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee\\'s assessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee\\'s longer-run objective, the FOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are likely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help move inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.\\nIt is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential--is currently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. The low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds--such as limited access to credit for some borrowers, weak growth abroad, and a significant appreciation of the dollar--that have weighed on aggregate demand.\\nOf course, monetary policy is by no means on a preset course. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In doing so, we will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with the attainment of our objectives over time.\\nConsistent with its previous communications, the Federal Reserve used interest on excess reserves (IOER) and overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) operations to move the federal funds rate into the new target range. The adjustment to the IOER rate has been particularly important in raising the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates more generally in an environment of abundant bank reserves. Meanwhile, overnight RRP operations complement the IOER rate by establishing a soft floor on money market interest rates. The IOER rate and the overnight RRP operations allowed the FOMC to control the federal funds rate effectively without having to first shrink its balance sheet by selling a large part of its holdings of longer-term securities. The Committee judged that removing monetary policy accommodation by the traditional approach of raising short-term interest rates is preferable to selling longer-term assets because such sales could be difficult to calibrate and could generate unexpected financial market reactions.\\nThe Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the December statement, the FOMC anticipates continuing this policy \"until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.\" Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and reduce the risk that we might need to return the federal funds rate target to the effective lower bound in response to future adverse shocks.']\n"

      "[\"before this Committee in February, the economy has made further progress toward the Federal Reserve's objective of maximum employment. And while inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent objective, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects inflation to rise to that level over the medium term. However, the pace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed more recently, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      In the labor market, the cumulative increase in jobs since its trough in early 2010 has now topped 14 million, while the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak.\", \"Despite these declines, however, it is troubling that unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median African American household is still well below the median income of other U.S. households.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      During the first quarter of this year, job gains averaged 200,000 per month, just a bit slower than last year's pace. And while the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent over this period, the labor force participation rate moved up noticeably. In April and May, however, the average pace of job gains slowed to only 80,000 per month or about 100,000 per month after adjustment for the effects of a strike. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, but that decline mainly occurred because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work. A broader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work was unchanged in May and remains above its level prior to the recession. Of course, it is important not to overreact to one or two reports, and several other timely indicators of labor market conditions still look favorable. One notable development is that there are some tentative signs that wage growth may finally be picking up. That said, we will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the recent slowing in employment growth is transitory, as we believe it is.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Economic growth has been uneven over recent quarters. U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of only 3/4 percent in the first quarter of this year. Subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar weighed on exports, while the energy sector was hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014; in addition, business investment outside of the energy sector was surprisingly weak. However, the available indicators point to a noticeable step-up in GDP growth in the second quarter. In particular, consumer spending has picked up smartly in recent months, supported by solid growth in real disposable income and the ongoing effects of the increases in household wealth. And housing has continued to recover gradually, aided by income gains and the very low level of mortgage rates.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The recent pickup in household spending, together with underlying conditions that are favorable for growth, lead me to be optimistic that we will see further improvements in the labor market and the economy more broadly over the next few years. Monetary policy remains accommodative; low oil prices and ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and therefore consumer spending; fiscal policy is now a small positive for growth; and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. As a result, the FOMC expects that with gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen further.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Turning to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased just 1 percent over the 12 months ending in April, up noticeably from its pace through much of last year but still well short of the Committee's 2 percent objective. Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices and lower prices for imports. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1-1/2 percent. As the transitory influences holding down inflation fade and the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the medium term. Nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Of course, considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains. The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk--that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue into the future. Vulnerabilities in the global economy also remain. Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. For all of these reasons, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and their implications for domestic economic activity, labor markets, and inflation.\", \"The FOMC seeks to promote maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Given the economic situation I just described, monetary policy has remained accommodative over the first half of this year to support further improvement in the labor market and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective. Specifically, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent and has kept the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at an elevated level.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The Committee's actions reflect a careful assessment of the appropriate setting for monetary policy, taking into account continuing below-target inflation and the mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth seen this year. Proceeding cautiously in raising the federal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary support to economic growth in place while we assess whether growth is returning to a moderate pace, whether the labor market will strengthen further, and whether inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent objective. Another factor that supports taking a cautious approach in raising the federal funds rate is that the federal funds rate is still near its effective lower bound. If inflation were to remain persistently low or the labor market were to weaken, the Committee would have only limited room to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. However, if the economy were to overheat and inflation seemed likely to move significantly or persistently above 2 percent, the FOMC could readily increase the target range for the federal funds rate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further and that the economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds--which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth--mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards. If these headwinds slowly fade over time, as the Committee expects, then gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be needed. In line with that view, most FOMC participants, based on their projections prepared for the June meeting, anticipate that values for the federal funds rate of less than 1 percent at the end of this year and less than 2 percent at the end of next year will be consistent with their assessment of appropriate monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Of course, the economic outlook is uncertain, so monetary policy is by no means on a preset course and FOMC participants' projections for the federal funds rate are not a predetermined plan for future policy. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and associated risks. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with their attainment over time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the statement released after the June FOMC meeting, we anticipate continuing this policy until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound in the event of a future large adverse shock.\"]\n"

      "[\"before this Committee last July, the employment situation in the United States has been improving along many dimensions. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.7 percent, down from just over 6 percent last summer and from 10 percent at its peak in late 2009. The average pace of monthly job gains picked up from about 240,000 per month during the first half of last year to 280,000 per month during the second half, and employment rose 260,000 in January. In addition, long-term unemployment has declined substantially, fewer workers are reporting that they can find only part-time work when they would prefer full-time employment, and the pace of quits--often regarded as a barometer of worker confidence in labor market opportunities--has recovered nearly to its pre-recession level. However, the labor force participation rate is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists. In short, considerable progress has been achieved in the recovery of the labor market, though room for further improvement remains.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At the same time that the labor market situation has improved, domestic spending and production have been increasing at a solid rate. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to have increased at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. While GDP growth is not anticipated to be sustained at that pace, it is expected to be strong enough to result in a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Consumer spending has been lifted by the improvement in the labor market as well as by the increase in household purchasing power resulting from the sharp drop in oil prices. However, housing construction continues to lag; activity remains well below levels we judge could be supported in the longer run by population growth and the likely rate of household formation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Despite the overall improvement in the U.S. economy and the U.S. economic outlook, longer-term interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies have moved down significantly since the middle of last year; the declines have reflected, at least in part, disappointing foreign growth and changes in monetary policy abroad. Another notable development has been the plunge in oil prices. The bulk of this decline appears to reflect increased global supply rather than weaker global demand. While the drop in oil prices will have negative effects on energy producers and will probably result in job losses in this sector, causing hardship for affected workers and their families, it will likely be a significant overall plus, on net, for our economy. Primarily, that boost will arise from U.S. households having the wherewithal to increase their spending on other goods and services as they spend less on gasoline.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Foreign economic developments, however, could pose risks to the outlook for U.S. economic growth. Although the pace of growth abroad appears to have stepped up slightly in the second half of last year, foreign economies are confronting a number of challenges that could restrain economic activity. In China, economic growth could slow more than anticipated as policymakers address financial vulnerabilities and manage the desired transition to less reliance on exports and investment as sources of growth. In the euro area, recovery remains slow, and inflation has fallen to very low levels; although highly accommodative monetary policy should help boost economic growth and inflation there, downside risks to economic activity in the region remain. The uncertainty surrounding the foreign outlook, however, does not exclusively reflect downside risks. We could see economic activity respond to the policy stimulus now being provided by foreign central banks more strongly than we currently anticipate, and the recent decline in world oil prices could boost overall global economic growth more than we expect.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       U.S. inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective. In large part, the recent softness in the all-items measure of inflation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) reflects the drop in oil prices. Indeed, the PCE price index edged down during the fourth quarter of last year and looks to be on track to register a more significant decline this quarter because of falling consumer energy prices. But core PCE inflation has also slowed since last summer, in part reflecting declines in the prices of many imported items and perhaps also some pass-through of lower energy costs into core consumer prices.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Despite the very low recent readings on actual inflation, inflation expectations as measured in a range of surveys of households and professional forecasters have thus far remained stable. However, inflation compensation, as calculated from the yields of real and nominal Treasury securities, has declined. As best we can tell, the fall in inflation compensation mainly reflects factors other than a reduction in longer-term inflation expectations. The Committee expects inflation to decline further in the near term before rising gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate, but we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.\", \"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our mandate from the Congress. As my description of economic developments indicated, our economy has made important progress toward the objective of maximum employment, reflecting in part support from the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in recent years. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions--the stated objective of the Committee's recent asset purchase program--the FOMC concluded that program at the end of October.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Even so, the Committee judges that a high degree of policy accommodation remains appropriate to foster further improvement in labor market conditions and to promote a return of inflation toward 2 percent over the medium term. Accordingly, the FOMC has continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to keep the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The FOMC is also providing forward guidance that offers information about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. In that regard, the Committee judged, in December and January, that it can be patient in beginning to raise the federal funds rate. This judgment reflects the fact that inflation continues to run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective, and that room for sustainable improvements in labor market conditions still remains.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The FOMC's assessment that it can be patient in beginning to normalize policy means that the Committee considers it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings. If economic conditions continue to improve, as the Committee anticipates, the Committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Before then, the Committee will change its forward guidance. However, it is important to emphasize that a modification of the forward guidance should not be read as indicating that the Committee will necessarily increase the target range in a couple of meetings. Instead the modification should be understood as reflecting the Committee's judgment that conditions have improved to the point where it will soon be the case that a change in the target range could be warranted at any meeting. Provided that labor market conditions continue to improve and further improvement is expected, the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when, on the basis of incoming data, the Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will move back over the medium term toward our 2 percent objective.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       It continues to be the FOMC's assessment that even after employment and inflation are near levels consistent with our dual mandate, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. It is possible, for example, that it may be necessary for the federal funds rate to run temporarily below its normal longer-run level because the residual effects of the financial crisis may continue to weigh on economic activity. As such factors continue to dissipate, we would expect the federal funds rate to move toward its longer-run normal level. In response to unforeseen developments, the Committee will adjust the target range for the federal funds rate to best promote the achievement of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\", \"turn to the mechanics of how we intend to normalize the stance and conduct of monetary policy when a decision is eventually made to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Last September, the FOMC issued its statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. This statement provides information about the Committee's likely approach to raising short-term interest rates and reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. As is always the case in setting policy, the Committee will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The FOMC intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily by changing its target range for the federal funds rate and not by actively managing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The Committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so and to maintain reasonable control of the level of short-term interest rates as policy continues to firm thereafter, even though the level of reserves held by depository institutions is likely to diminish only gradually. The primary means of raising the federal funds rate will be to increase the rate of interest paid on excess reserves. The Committee also will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate. As economic and financial conditions evolve, the Committee will phase out these supplementary tools when they are no longer needed.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee intends to reduce its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal from securities held by the Federal Reserve. It is the Committee's intention to hold, in the longer run, no more securities than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy, and that these securities be primarily Treasury securities.\", \"progress toward the FOMC's objective of maximum employment. However, despite this improvement, too many Americans remain unemployed or underemployed, wage growth is still sluggish, and inflation remains well below our longer-run objective. As always, the Federal Reserve remains committed to employing its tools to best promote the attainment of its objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\"]\n"

      "[\"before this Committee in February, the economy has made further progress toward the Federal Reserve's objective of maximum employment, while inflation has continued to run below the level that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges to be most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      In the labor market, the unemployment rate now stands at 5.3 percent, slightly below its level at the end of last year and down more than 4-1/2 percentage points from its 10 percent peak in late 2009. Meanwhile, monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 210,000 over the first half of this year, somewhat less than the robust 260,000 average seen in 2014 but still sufficient to bring the total increase in employment since its trough to more than 12 million jobs. Other measures of job market health are also trending in the right direction, with noticeable declines over the past year in the number of people suffering long-term unemployment and in the numbers working part time who would prefer full-time employment. However, these measures--as well as the unemployment rate--continue to indicate that there is still some slack in labor markets. For example, too many people are not searching for a job but would likely do so if the labor market was stronger. And, although there are tentative signs that wage growth has picked up, it continues to be relatively subdued, consistent with other indications of slack. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, they are, in the FOMC's judgment, not yet consistent with maximum employment.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Even as the labor market was improving, domestic spending and production softened notably during the first half of this year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to have been little changed in the first quarter after having risen at an average annual rate of 3-1/2 percent over the second half of last year, and industrial production has declined a bit, on balance, since the turn of the year. While these developments bear watching, some of this sluggishness seems to be the result of transitory factors, including unusually severe winter weather, labor disruptions at West Coast ports, and statistical noise. The available data suggest a moderate pace of GDP growth in the second quarter as these influences dissipate. Notably, consumer spending has picked up, and sales of motor vehicles in May and June were strong, suggesting that many households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase big-ticket items. In addition, homebuilding has picked up somewhat lately, although the demand for housing is still being restrained by limited availability of mortgage loans to many potential homebuyers. Business investment has been soft this year, partly reflecting the plunge in oil drilling. And net exports are being held down by weak economic growth in several of our major trading partners and the appreciation of the dollar.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Looking forward, prospects are favorable for further improvement in the U.S. labor market and the economy more broadly. Low oil prices and ongoing employment gains should continue to bolster consumer spending, financial conditions generally remain supportive of growth, and the highly accommodative monetary policies abroad should work to strengthen global growth. In addition, some of the headwinds restraining economic growth, including the effects of dollar appreciation on net exports and the effect of lower oil prices on capital spending, should diminish over time. As a result, the FOMC expects U.S. GDP growth to strengthen over the remainder of this year and the unemployment rate to decline gradually.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      As always, however, there are some uncertainties in the economic outlook. Foreign developments, in particular, pose some risks to U.S. growth. Most notably, although the recovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece remains difficult. And China continues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property markets, and volatile financial conditions. But economic growth abroad could also pick up more quickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for U.S. economic activity. The U.S. economy also might snap back more quickly as the transitory influences holding down first-half growth fade and the boost to consumer spending from low oil prices shows through more definitively.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      As I noted earlier, inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index up only 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in May and the core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, up only 1-1/4 percent over the same period. To a significant extent, the recent low readings on total PCE inflation reflect influences that are likely to be transitory, particularly the earlier steep declines in oil prices and in the prices of non-energy imported goods. Indeed, energy prices appear to have stabilized recently.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Although monthly inflation readings have firmed lately, the 12-month change in the PCE price index is likely to remain near its recent low level in the near term. My colleagues and I continue to expect that as the effects of these transitory factors dissipate and as the labor market improves further, inflation will move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low--although they have risen some from their levels earlier this year--and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Committee will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.\", \"the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Given the economic situation that I just described, the Committee has judged that a high degree of monetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have kept the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      In its most recent statement, the FOMC again noted that it judged it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee will determine the timing of the initial increase in the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on its assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. Indeed, most participants in June projected that an increase in the federal funds target range would likely become appropriate before year-end. But let me emphasize again that these are projections based on the anticipated path of the economy, not statements of intent to raise rates at any particular time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      A decision by the Committee to raise its target range for the federal funds rate will signal how much progress the economy has made in healing from the trauma of the financial crisis. That said, the importance of the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target should not be overemphasized. What matters for financial conditions and the broader economy is the entire expected path of interest rates, not any particular move, including the initial increase, in the federal funds rate. Indeed, the stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the first increase in the federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In the projections prepared for our June meeting, most FOMC participants anticipated that economic conditions would evolve over time in a way that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate as the headwinds that still restrain real activity continue to diminish and inflation rises. Of course, if the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a higher and steeper trajectory; conversely, if conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropriate trajectory would be lower and less steep than currently projected. As always, we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining the Committee's dual mandate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      I would also like to note that the Federal Reserve has continued to refine its operational plans pertaining to the deployment of our various policy tools when the Committee judges it appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of policy. Last fall, the Committee issued a detailed statement concerning its plans for policy normalization and, over the past few months, we have announced a number of additional details regarding the approach the Committee intends to use when it decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\", \"constitute recent examples of the many steps the Federal Reserve has taken over the years to improve our public communications concerning monetary policy. As this Committee well knows, the Board has for many years delivered an extensive report on monetary policy and economic developments at semiannual hearings such as this one. And the FOMC has long announced its monetary policy decisions by issuing statements shortly after its meetings, followed by minutes of its meetings with a full account of policy discussions and, with an appropriate lag, complete meeting transcripts. Innovations in recent years have included quarterly press conferences and the quarterly release of FOMC participants' projections for economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and the appropriate path for the Committee's interest rate target. In addition, the Committee adopted a statement in 2012 concerning its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that included a specific 2 percent longer-run objective for inflation and a commitment to follow a balanced approach in pursuing our mandated goals.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      Transparency concerning the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy is desirable because better public understanding enhances the effectiveness of policy. More important, however, is that transparent communications reflect the Federal Reserve's commitment to accountability within our democratic system of government. Our various communications tools are important means of implementing monetary policy and have many technical elements. Each step forward in our communications practices has been taken with the goal of enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy and avoiding unintended consequences. Effective communication is also crucial to ensuring that the Federal Reserve remains accountable, but measures that affect the ability of policymakers to make decisions about monetary policy free of short-term political pressure, in the name of transparency, should be avoided.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n      The Federal Reserve ranks among the most transparent central banks. We publish a summary of our balance sheet every week. Our financial statements are audited annually by an outside auditor and made public. Every security we hold is listed on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. And, in conformance with the Dodd-Frank Act, transaction-level data on all of our lending--including the identity of borrowers and the amounts borrowed--are published with a two-year lag. Efforts to further increase transparency, no matter how well intentioned, must avoid unintended consequences that could undermine the Federal Reserve's ability to make policy in the long-run best interest of American families and businesses.\", 'despite the soft patch in economic activity in the first quarter, that the labor market has continued to show progress toward our objective of maximum employment. Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, but we believe transitory factors have played a major role. We continue to anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. As always, the Federal Reserve remains committed to employing its tools to best promote the attainment of its dual mandate.']\n"

      "['recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have risen at an average annual rate of more than 3-1/2 percent in the third and fourth quarters, up from a 1-3/4 percent pace in the first half. The pickup in economic activity has fueled further progress in the labor market. About 1-1/4 million jobs have been added to payrolls', \"and 3-1/4 million have been added since August 2012, the month before the Federal Reserve began a new round of asset purchases to add momentum to the recovery. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly a percentage point since the middle of last year and 1-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the current asset purchase program. Nevertheless, the recovery in the labor market is far from complete. The unemployment rate is still well above levels that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants estimate is consistent with maximum sustainable employment. Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Among the major components of GDP, household and business spending growth stepped up during the second half of last year. Early in 2013, growth in consumer spending was restrained by changes in fiscal policy. As this restraint abated during the second half of the year, household spending accelerated, supported by job gains and by rising home values and equity prices. Similarly, growth in business investment started off slowly last year but then picked up during the second half, reflecting improving sales prospects, greater confidence, and still-favorable financing conditions. In contrast, the recovery in the housing sector slowed in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation remained low as the economy picked up strength, with both the headline and core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price indexes rising only about 1 percent last year, well below the FOMC's 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. Some of the recent softness reflects factors that seem likely to prove transitory, including falling prices for crude oil and declines in non-oil import prices.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       My colleagues on the FOMC and I anticipate that economic activity and employment will expand at a moderate pace this year and next, the unemployment rate will continue to decline toward its longer-run sustainable level, and inflation will move back toward 2 percent over coming years. We have been watching closely the recent volatility in global financial markets. Our sense is that at this stage these developments do not pose a substantial risk to the U.S. economic outlook. We will, of course, continue to monitor the situation.\", \"let me emphasize that I expect a great deal of continuity in the FOMC's approach to monetary policy. I served on the Committee as we formulated our current policy strategy and I strongly support that strategy, which is designed to fulfill the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Prior to the financial crisis, the FOMC carried out monetary policy by adjusting its target for the federal funds rate. With that rate near zero since late 2008, we have relied on two less-traditional tools--asset purchases and forward guidance--to help the economy move toward maximum employment and price stability. Both tools put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and support asset prices. In turn, these more accommodative financial conditions support consumer spending, business investment, and housing construction, adding impetus to the recovery.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Our current program of asset purchases began in September 2012 amid signs that the recovery was weakening and progress in the labor market had slowed. The Committee said that it would continue the program until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. In mid-2013, the Committee indicated that if progress toward its objectives continued as expected, a moderation in the monthly pace of purchases would likely become appropriate later in the year. In December, the Committee judged that the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions warranted a modest reduction in the pace of purchases, from $45 billion to $40 billion per month of longer-term Treasury securities and from $40 billion to $35 billion per month of agency mortgage-backed securities. At its January meeting, the Committee decided to make additional reductions of the same magnitude. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. That said, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee has emphasized that a highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after asset purchases end. In addition, the Committee has said since December 2012 that it expects the current low target range for the federal funds rate to be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above our 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Crossing one of these thresholds will not automatically prompt an increase in the federal funds rate, but will instead indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook would justify such an increase. In December of last year and again this January, the Committee said that its current expectation--based on its assessment of a broad range of measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments--is that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the 2 percent goal. I am committed to achieving both parts of our dual mandate: helping the economy return to full employment and returning inflation to 2 percent while ensuring that it does not run persistently above or below that level.\", 'on progress on regulatory reforms and supervisory actions to strengthen the financial system. In October, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule to strengthen the liquidity positions of large and internationally active financial institutions.1 Together with other federal agencies, the Board also issued a final rule implementing the Volcker rule, which prohibits banking firms from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain financial instruments.2 On the supervisory front, the next round of annual capital stress tests of the largest 30 bank holding companies is under way, and we expect to report results in March.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Regulatory and supervisory actions, including those that are leading to substantial increases in capital and liquidity in the banking sector, are making our financial system more resilient. Still, important tasks lie ahead. In the near term, we expect to finalize the rules implementing enhanced prudential standards mandated by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We also are working to finalize the proposed rule strengthening the leverage ratio standards for U.S.-based, systemically important global banks. We expect to issue proposals for a risk-based capital surcharge for those banks as well as for a long-term debt requirement to help ensure that these organizations can be resolved. In addition, we are working to advance proposals on margins for noncleared derivatives, consistent with a new global framework, and are evaluating possible measures to address financial stability risks associated with short-term wholesale funding. We will continue to monitor for emerging risks, including watching carefully to see if the regulatory reforms work as intended.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Since the financial crisis and the depths of the recession, substantial progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Still, there is more to do. Too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and the work of making the financial system more robust has not yet been completed. I look forward to working with my colleagues and many others to carry out the important mission you have given the Federal Reserve.']\n"

      "[\"to make progress toward the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the labor market, gains in total nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 230,000 per month over the first half of this year, a somewhat stronger pace than in 2013 and enough to bring the total increase in jobs during the economic recovery thus far to more than 9 million. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1-1/2 percentage points over the past year and stood at 6.1 percent in June, down about 4 percentage points from its peak. Broader measures of labor utilization have also registered notable improvements over the past year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have declined sharply in the first quarter. The decline appears to have resulted mostly from transitory factors, and a number of recent indicators of production and spending suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter, but this bears close watching. The housing sector, however, has shown little recent progress. While this sector has recovered notably from its earlier trough, housing activity leveled off in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates, and readings this year have, overall, continued to be disappointing.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Although the economy continues to improve, the recovery is not yet complete. Even with the recent declines, the unemployment rate remains above Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. Labor force participation appears weaker than one would expect based on the aging of the population and the level of unemployment. These and other indications that significant slack remains in labor markets are corroborated by the continued slow pace of growth in most measures of hourly compensation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation has moved up in recent months but remains below the FOMC's 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months through May. Pressures on food and energy prices account for some of the increase in PCE price inflation. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 1.5 percent. Most Committee participants project that both total and core inflation will be between 1-1/2 and 1-3/4 percent for this year as a whole.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Although the decline in GDP in the first quarter led to some downgrading of our growth projections for this year, I and other FOMC participants continue to anticipate that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace over the next several years, supported by accommodative monetary policy, a waning drag from fiscal policy, the lagged effects of higher home prices and equity values, and strengthening foreign growth. The Committee sees the projected pace of economic growth as sufficient to support ongoing improvement in the labor market with further job gains, and the unemployment rate is anticipated to continue to decline toward its longer-run sustainable level. Consistent with the anticipated further recovery in the labor market, and given that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, we expect inflation to move back toward our 2 percent objective over coming years.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As always, considerable uncertainty surrounds our projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. FOMC participants currently judge these risks to be nearly balanced but to warrant monitoring in the months ahead.\", \"The FOMC is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our dual mandate from the Congress. Given the economic situation that I just described, we judge that a high degree of monetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have continued to rely on large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate to provide the appropriate level of support for the economy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment that has occurred since the inception of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program in September 2012 and the FOMC's assessment that labor market conditions would continue to improve, the Committee has made measured reductions in the monthly pace of our asset purchases at each of our regular meetings this year. If incoming data continue to support our expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward 2 percent, the Committee likely will make further measured reductions in the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings, with purchases concluding after the October meeting. Even after the Committee ends these purchases, the Federal Reserve's sizable holdings of longer-term securities will help maintain accommodative financial conditions, thus supporting further progress in returning employment and inflation to mandate-consistent levels.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee is also fostering accommodative financial conditions through forward guidance that provides greater clarity about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. Since March, our postmeeting statements have included a description of the framework that is guiding our monetary policy decisions. Specifically, our decisions are and will be based on an assessment of the progress--both realized and expected--toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Our evaluation will not hinge on one or two factors, but rather will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation and long-term inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Based on its assessment of these factors, in June the Committee reiterated its expectation that the current target range for the federal funds rate likely will be appropriate for a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal and provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored. In addition, we currently anticipate that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels that the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Of course, the outlook for the economy and financial markets is never certain, and now is no exception. Therefore, the Committee's decisions about the path of the federal funds rate remain dependent on our assessment of incoming information and the implications for the economic outlook. If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned. Conversely, if economic performance is disappointing, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than currently anticipated.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee remains confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when the time is right and to achieve the desired level of short-term interest rates thereafter, even with the Federal Reserve's elevated balance sheet. At our meetings this spring, we have been constructively working through the many issues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy. These ongoing discussions are a matter of prudent planning and do not imply any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy. The Committee will continue its discussions in upcoming meetings, and we expect to provide additional information later this year.\", 'that low interest rates may provide incentives for some investors to \"reach for yield,\" and those actions could increase vulnerabilities in the financial system to adverse events. While prices of real estate, equities, and corporate bonds have risen appreciably and valuation metrics have increased, they remain generally in line with historical norms. In some sectors, such as lower-rated corporate debt, valuations appear stretched and issuance has been brisk. Accordingly, we are closely monitoring developments in the leveraged loan market and are working to enhance the effectiveness of our supervisory guidance. More broadly, the financial sector has continued to become more resilient, as banks have continued to boost their capital and liquidity positions, and growth in wholesale short-term funding in financial markets has been modest.', 'Yet too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and not all of the necessary financial reform initiatives have been completed. The Federal Reserve remains committed to employing all of its resources and tools to achieve its macroeconomic objectives and to foster a stronger and more resilient financial system.']\n"

      "[\"to this Committee in mid-2012, economic activity in the United States has continued to expand at a moderate if somewhat uneven pace. In particular, real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter but to have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter.1 The pause in real GDP growth last quarter does not appear to reflect a stalling-out of the recovery. Rather, economic activity was temporarily restrained by weather-related disruptions and by transitory declines in a few volatile categories of spending, even as demand by U.S. households and businesses continued to expand. Available information suggests that economic growth has picked up again this year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consistent with the moderate pace of economic growth, conditions in the labor market have been improving gradually. Since July, nonfarm payroll employment has increased by 175,000 jobs per month on average, and the unemployment rate declined 0.3 percentage point to 7.9 percent over the same period. Cumulatively, private-sector payrolls have now grown by about 6.1 million jobs since their low point in early 2010, and the unemployment rate has fallen a bit more than 2 percentage points since its cyclical peak in late 2009. Despite these gains, however, the job market remains generally weak, with the unemployment rate well above its longer-run normal level. About 4.7 million of the unemployed have been without a job for six months or more, and millions more would like full-time employment but are able to find only part-time work. High unemployment has substantial costs, including not only the hardship faced by the unemployed and their families, but also the harm done to the vitality and productive potential of our economy as a whole. Lengthy periods of unemployment and underemployment can erode workers' skills and attachment to the labor force or prevent young people from gaining skills and experience in the first place--developments that could significantly reduce their productivity and earnings in the longer term. The loss of output and earnings associated with high unemployment also reduces government revenues and increases spending, thereby leading to larger deficits and higher levels of debt.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The recent increase in gasoline prices, which reflects both higher crude oil prices and wider refining margins, is hitting family budgets. However, overall inflation remains low. Over the second half of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent, similar to the rate of increase in the first half of the year. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained in the narrow ranges seen over the past several years. Against this backdrop, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.\", 'above normal levels and inflation subdued, progress toward the Federal Reserve\\'s mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability has required a highly accommodative monetary policy. Under normal circumstances, policy accommodation would be provided through reductions in the FOMC\\'s target for the federal funds rate--the interest rate on overnight loans between banks. However, as this rate has been close to zero since December 2008, the Federal Reserve has had to use alternative policy tools.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       These alternative tools have fallen into two categories. The first is \"forward guidance\" regarding the FOMC\\'s anticipated path for the federal funds rate. Since longer-term interest rates reflect market expectations for shorter-term rates over time, our guidance influences longer-term rates and thus supports a stronger recovery. The formulation of this guidance has evolved over time. Between August 2011 and December 2012, the Committee used calendar dates to indicate how long it expected economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate. At its December 2012 meeting, the FOMC agreed to shift to providing more explicit guidance on how it expects the policy rate to respond to economic developments. Specifically, the December postmeeting statement indicated that the current exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate \"will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee\\'s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\"2 An advantage of the new formulation, relative to the previous date-based guidance, is that it allows market participants and the public to update their monetary policy expectations more accurately in response to new information about the economic outlook. The new guidance also serves to underscore the Committee\\'s intention to maintain accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with stable prices.3\\n\\n\\r\\n       The second type of nontraditional policy tool employed by the FOMC is large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, which, like our forward guidance, are intended to support economic growth by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has engaged in several rounds of such purchases since late 2008. Last September the FOMC announced that it would purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month, and in December the Committee stated that, in addition, beginning in January it would purchase longer-term Treasury securities at an initial pace of $45 billion per month.4 These additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities replace the purchases we were conducting under our now-completed maturity extension program, which lengthened the maturity of our securities portfolio without increasing its size. The FOMC has indicated that it will continue purchases until it observes a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee also stated that in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, it will take appropriate account of their likely efficacy and costs. In other words, as with all of its policy decisions, the Committee continues to assess its program of asset purchases within a cost-benefit framework. In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases, and of policy accommodation more generally, are clear: Monetary policy is providing important support to the recovery while keeping inflation close to the FOMC\\'s 2 percent objective. Notably, keeping longer-term interest rates low has helped spark recovery in the housing market and led to increased sales and production of automobiles and other durable goods. By raising employment and household wealth--for example, through higher home prices‑‑these developments have in turn supported consumer sentiment and spending.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Highly accommodative monetary policy also has several potential costs and risks, which the Committee is monitoring closely. For example, if further expansion of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet were to undermine public confidence in our ability to exit smoothly from our accommodative policies at the appropriate time, inflation expectations could rise, putting the FOMC\\'s price-stability objective at risk. However, the Committee remains confident that it has the tools necessary to tighten monetary policy when the time comes to do so. As I noted, inflation is currently subdued, and inflation expectations appear well anchored; neither the FOMC nor private forecasters are projecting the development of significant inflation pressures.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Another potential cost that the Committee takes very seriously is the possibility that very low interest rates, if maintained for a considerable time, could impair financial stability. For example, portfolio managers dissatisfied with low returns may \"reach for yield\" by taking on more credit risk, duration risk, or leverage. On the other hand, some risk-taking--such as when an entrepreneur takes out a loan to start a new business or an existing firm expands capacity--is a necessary element of a healthy economic recovery. Moreover, although accommodative monetary policies may increase certain types of risk-taking, in the present circumstances they also serve in some ways to reduce risk in the system, most importantly by strengthening the overall economy, but also by encouraging firms to rely more on longer-term funding, and by reducing debt service costs for households and businesses. In any case, the Federal Reserve is responding actively to financial stability concerns through substantially expanded monitoring of emerging risks in the financial system, an approach to the supervision of financial firms that takes a more systemic perspective, and the ongoing implementation of reforms to make the financial system more transparent and resilient. Although a long period of low rates could encourage excessive risk-taking, and continued close attention to such developments is certainly warranted, to this point we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more-rapid job creation.5\\n\\n\\r\\n       Another aspect of the Federal Reserve\\'s policies that has been discussed is their implications for the federal budget. The Federal Reserve earns substantial interest on the assets it holds in its portfolio, and, other than the amount needed to fund our cost of operations, all net income is remitted to the Treasury. With the expansion of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet, yearly remittances have roughly tripled in recent years, with payments to the Treasury totaling approximately $290 billion between 2009 and 2012.6 However, if the economy continues to strengthen, as we anticipate, and policy accommodation is accordingly reduced, these remittances would likely decline in coming years. Federal Reserve analysis shows that remittances to the Treasury could be quite low for a time in some scenarios, particularly if interest rates were to rise quickly.7 However, even in such scenarios, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by the Federal Reserve\\'s purchases will remain higher than the pre-crisis norm, perhaps substantially so. Moreover, to the extent that monetary policy promotes growth and job creation, the resulting reduction in the federal deficit would dwarf any variation in the Federal Reserve\\'s remittances to the Treasury.', 'Text not found']\n"

      "[\"has continued at a moderate pace in recent quarters despite the strong headwinds created by federal fiscal policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Housing has contributed significantly to recent gains in economic activity. Home sales, house prices, and residential construction have moved up over the past year, supported by low mortgage rates and improved confidence in both the housing market and the economy. Rising housing construction and home sales are adding to job growth, and substantial increases in home prices are bolstering household finances and consumer spending while reducing the number of homeowners with underwater mortgages. Housing activity and prices seem likely to continue to recover, notwithstanding the recent increases in mortgage rates, but it will be important to monitor developments in this sector carefully.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Conditions in the labor market are improving gradually. The unemployment rate stood at 7.6 percent in June, about a half percentage point lower than in the months before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) initiated its current asset purchase program in September. Nonfarm payroll employment has increased by an average of about 200,000 jobs per month so far this year. Despite these gains, the jobs situation is far from satisfactory, as the unemployment rate remains well above its longer-run normal level, and rates of underemployment and long-term unemployment are still much too high.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Meanwhile, consumer price inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent. The price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only 1 percent over the year ending in May. This softness reflects in part some factors that are likely to be transitory. Moreover, measures of longer-term inflation expectations have generally remained stable, which should help move inflation back up toward 2 percent. However, the Committee is certainly aware that very low inflation poses risks to economic performance--for example, by raising the real cost of capital investment--and increases the risk of outright deflation. Consequently, we will monitor this situation closely as well, and we will act as needed to ensure that inflation moves back toward our 2 percent objective over time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At the June FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I projected that economic growth would pick up in coming quarters, resulting in gradual progress toward the levels of unemployment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability. Specifically, most participants saw real GDP growth beginning to step up during the second half of this year, eventually reaching a pace between 2.9 and 3.6 percent in 2015. They projected the unemployment rate to decline to between 5.8 and 6.2 percent by the final quarter of 2015. And they saw inflation gradually increasing toward the Committee's 2 percent objective.1\\xa0\\n\\n\\r\\n       The pickup in economic growth projected by most Committee participants partly reflects their view that federal fiscal policy will exert somewhat less drag over time, as the effects of the tax increases and the spending sequestration diminish. The Committee also believes that risks to the economy have diminished since the fall, reflecting some easing of financial stresses in Europe, the gains in housing and labor markets that I mentioned earlier, the better budgetary positions of state and local governments, and stronger household and business balance sheets. That said, the risks remain that tight federal fiscal policy will restrain economic growth over the next few quarters by more than we currently expect, or that the debate concerning other fiscal policy issues, such as the status of the debt ceiling, will evolve in a way that could hamper the recovery. More generally, with the recovery still proceeding at only a moderate pace, the economy remains vulnerable to unanticipated shocks, including the possibility that global economic growth may be slower than currently anticipated.\", 'high and declining only gradually, and with inflation running below the Committee\\'s longer-run objective, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for the foreseeable future.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In normal circumstances, the Committee\\'s basic tool for providing monetary accommodation is its target for the federal funds rate. However, the target range for the federal funds rate has been close to zero since late 2008 and cannot be reduced meaningfully further. Instead, we are providing additional policy accommodation through two distinct yet complementary policy tools. The first tool is expanding the Federal Reserve\\'s portfolio of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS); we are currently purchasing $40 billion per month in agency MBS and $45 billion per month in Treasuries. The second tool is \"forward guidance\" about the Committee\\'s plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the medium term.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Within our overall policy framework, we think of these two tools as having somewhat different roles. We are using asset purchases and the resulting expansion of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet primarily to increase the near-term momentum of the economy, with the specific goal of achieving a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. We have made some progress toward this goal, and, with inflation subdued, we intend to continue our purchases until a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook has been realized. In addition, even after purchases end, the Federal Reserve will be holding its stock of Treasury and agency securities off the market and reinvesting the proceeds from maturing securities, which will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We are relying on near-zero short-term interest rates, together with our forward guidance that rates will continue to be exceptionally low--our second tool--to help maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation for an extended period after asset purchases end, even as the economic recovery strengthens and unemployment declines toward more-normal levels. In appropriate combination, these two tools can provide the high level of policy accommodation needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the interest of transparency, Committee participants agreed in June that it would be helpful to lay out more details about our thinking regarding the asset purchase program--specifically, to provide additional information on our assessment of progress to date, as well as of the likely trajectory of the program if the economy evolves as projected. This agreement to provide additional information did not reflect a change in policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee\\'s decisions regarding the asset purchase program (and the overall stance of monetary policy) depend on our assessment of the economic outlook and of the cumulative progress toward our objectives. Of course, economic forecasts must be revised when new information arrives and are thus necessarily provisional. As I noted, the economic outcomes that Committee participants saw as most likely in their June projections involved continuing gains in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the restraint from fiscal policy diminishes. Committee participants also saw inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time. If the incoming data were to be broadly consistent with these projections, we anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year. And if the subsequent data continued to confirm this pattern of ongoing economic improvement and normalizing inflation, we expected to continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending them around midyear. At that point, if the economy had evolved along the lines we anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward our 2 percent objective. Such outcomes would be fully consistent with the goals of the asset purchase program that we established in September.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       I emphasize that, because our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, they are by no means on a preset course. On the one hand, if economic conditions were to improve faster than expected, and inflation appeared to be rising decisively back toward our objective, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly. On the other hand, if the outlook for employment were to become relatively less favorable, if inflation did not appear to be moving back toward 2 percent, or if financial conditions--which have tightened recently--were judged to be insufficiently accommodative to allow us to attain our mandated objectives, the current pace of purchases could be maintained for longer. Indeed, if needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I noted, the second tool the Committee is using to support the recovery is forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate. The Committee has said it intends to maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee anticipates that its current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6‑1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the sense described in the FOMC\\'s statement.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I have observed on several occasions, the phrase \"at least as long as\" is a key component of the policy rate guidance. These words indicate that the specific numbers for unemployment and inflation in the guidance are thresholds, not triggers. Reaching one of the thresholds would not automatically result in an increase in the federal funds rate target; rather, it would lead the Committee to consider whether the outlook for the labor market, inflation, and the broader economy justified such an increase. For example, if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment, the Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6-1/2 percent as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate. Likewise, the Committee would be unlikely to raise the funds rate if inflation remained persistently below our longer-run objective. Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer-run objective, and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual.', 'providing you with a brief update on progress on reforms to reduce the systemic risk of the largest financial firms. As Governor Tarullo discussed in his testimony last week before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, the Federal Reserve, with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a final rule earlier this month to implement the Basel III capital reforms.2 The final rule increases the quantity and quality of required regulatory capital by establishing a new minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio and implementing a capital conservation buffer. The rule also contains a supplementary leverage ratio and a countercyclical capital buffer that apply only to large and internationally active banking organizations, consistent with their systemic importance. In addition, the Federal Reserve will propose capital surcharges on firms that pose the greatest systemic risk and will issue a proposal to implement the Basel III quantitative liquidity requirements as they are phased in over the next few years. The Federal Reserve is considering further measures to strengthen the capital positions of large, internationally active banks, including the proposed rule issued last week that would increase the required leverage ratios for such firms.3\\xa0\\n\\n\\r\\n       The Fed also is working to finalize the enhanced prudential standards set out in sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among these standards, rules relating to stress testing and resolution planning already are in place, and we have been actively engaged in stress tests and reviewing the \"first-wave\" resolution plans. In coordination with other agencies, we have made significant progress on the key substantive issues relating to the Volcker rule and are hoping to complete it by year-end.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Finally, the Federal Reserve is preparing to regulate and supervise systemically important nonbank financial firms. Last week, the Financial Stability Oversight Council designated two nonbank financial firms; it has proposed the designation of a third firm, which has requested a hearing before the council.4 We are developing a supervisory and regulatory framework that can be tailored to each firm\\'s business mix, risk profile, and systemic footprint, consistent with the Collins amendment and other legal requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.']\n"

      "[\"economy continues, but the pace of expansion has been uneven and modest by historical standards. After minimal gains in the first half of last year, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2-1/4 percent annual rate in the second half.1 The limited information available for 2012 is consistent with growth proceeding, in coming quarters, at a pace close to or somewhat above the pace that was registered during the second half of last year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We have seen some positive developments in the labor market. Private payroll employment has increased by 165,000 jobs per month on average since the middle of last year, and nearly 260,000 new private-sector jobs were added in January. The job gains in recent months have been relatively widespread across industries. In the public sector, by contrast, layoffs by state and local governments have continued. The unemployment rate hovered around 9 percent for much of last year but has moved down appreciably since September, reaching 8.3 percent in January. New claims for unemployment insurance benefits have also moderated.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The decline in the unemployment rate over the past year has been somewhat more rapid than might have been expected, given that the economy appears to have been growing during that time frame at or below its longer-term trend; continued improvement in the job market is likely to require stronger growth in final demand and production. Notwithstanding the better recent data, the job market remains far from normal: The unemployment rate remains elevated, long-term unemployment is still near record levels, and the number of persons working part time for economic reasons is very high.2\\n\\n\\r\\n       Household spending advanced moderately in the second half of last year, boosted by a fourth-quarter surge in motor vehicle purchases that was facilitated by an easing of constraints on supply related to the earthquake in Japan. However, the fundamentals that support spending continue to be weak: Real household income and wealth were flat in 2011, and access to credit remained restricted for many potential borrowers. Consumer sentiment, which dropped sharply last summer, has since rebounded but remains relatively low.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the housing sector, affordability has increased dramatically as a result of the decline in house prices and historically low interest rates on conventional mortgages. Unfortunately, many potential buyers lack the down payment and credit history required to qualify for loans; others are reluctant to buy a house now because of concerns about their income, employment prospects, and the future path of home prices. On the supply side of the market, about 30 percent of recent home sales have consisted of foreclosed or distressed properties, and home vacancy rates remain high, putting downward pressure on house prices. More-positive signs include a pickup in construction in the multifamily sector and recent increases in homebuilder sentiment.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Manufacturing production has increased 15 percent since the trough of the recession and has posted solid gains since the middle of last year, supported by the recovery in motor vehicle supply chains and ongoing increases in business investment and exports. Real business spending for equipment and software rose at an annual rate of about 12 percent over the second half of 2011, a bit faster than in the first half of the year. But real export growth, while remaining solid, slowed somewhat over the same period as foreign economic activity decelerated, particularly in Europe.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The members of the Board and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks recently projected that economic activity in 2012 will expand at or somewhat above the pace registered in the second half of last year. Specifically, their projections for growth in real GDP this year, provided in conjunction with the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent.3 These forecasts were considerably lower than the projections they made last June.4 A number of factors have played a role in this reassessment. First, the annual revisions to the national income and product accounts released last summer indicated that the recovery had been somewhat slower than previously estimated. In addition, fiscal and financial strains in Europe have weighed on financial conditions and global economic growth, and problems in U.S. housing and mortgage markets have continued to hold down not only construction and related industries, but also household wealth and confidence. Looking beyond 2012, FOMC participants expect that economic activity will pick up gradually as these headwinds fade, supported by a continuation of the highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       With output growth in 2012 projected to remain close to its longer-run trend, participants did not anticipate further substantial declines in the unemployment rate over the course of this year. Looking beyond this year, FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down only slowly toward levels consistent with the Committee's statutory mandate. In light of the somewhat different signals received recently from the labor market than from indicators of final demand and production, however, it will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess the underlying pace of economic recovery.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At our January meeting, participants agreed that strains in global financial markets posed significant downside risks to the economic outlook. Investors' concerns about fiscal deficits and the levels of government debt in a number of European countries have led to substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs, stresses in the European banking system, and associated reductions in the availability of credit and economic activity in the euro area. To help prevent strains in Europe from spilling over to the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve in November agreed to extend and to modify the terms of its swap lines with other major central banks, and it continues to monitor the European exposures of U.S. financial institutions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       A number of constructive policy actions have been taken of late in Europe, including the European Central Bank's program to extend three-year collateralized loans to European financial institutions. Most recently, European policymakers agreed on a new package of measures for Greece, which combines additional official-sector loans with a sizable reduction of Greek debt held by the private sector. However, critical fiscal and financial challenges remain for the euro zone, the resolution of which will require concerted action on the part of European authorities. Further steps will also be required to boost growth and competitiveness in a number of countries. We are in frequent contact with our counterparts in Europe and will continue to follow the situation closely.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I discussed in my July testimony, inflation picked up during the early part of 2011.5 A surge in the prices of oil and other commodities, along with supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan that put upward pressure on motor vehicle prices, pushed overall inflation to an annual rate of more than 3 percent over the first half of last year.6 As we had expected, however, these factors proved transitory, and inflation moderated to an annual rate of 1‑1/2 percent during the second half of the year--close to its average pace in the preceding two years. In the projections made in January, the Committee anticipated that, over coming quarters, inflation will run at or below the 2 percent level we judge most consistent with our statutory mandate. Specifically, the central tendency of participants' forecasts for inflation in 2012 ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 percent, about unchanged from the projections made last June.7 Looking farther ahead, participants expected the subdued level of inflation to persist beyond this year. Since these projections were made, gasoline prices have moved up, primarily reflecting higher global oil prices--a development that is likely to push up inflation temporarily while reducing consumers' purchasing power. We will continue to monitor energy markets carefully. Longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by surveys and financial market indicators, appear consistent with the view that inflation will remain subdued.\", \"backdrop of restrained growth, persistent downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and moderating inflation, the Committee took several steps to provide additional monetary accommodation during the second half of 2011 and early 2012. These steps included changes to the forward rate guidance included in the Committee's post-meeting statements and adjustments to the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury and agency securities.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The target range for the federal funds rate remains at 0 to 1/4 percent, and the forward guidance language in the FOMC policy statement provides an indication of how long the Committee expects that target range to be appropriate. In August, the Committee clarified the forward guidance language, noting that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through the middle of 2013. By providing a longer time horizon than had previously been expected by the public, the statement tended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. At the January 2012 FOMC meeting, the Committee amended the forward guidance further, extending the horizon over which it expects economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate to at least through late 2014.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to the adjustments made to the forward guidance, the Committee modified its policies regarding the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities. In September, the Committee put in place a maturity extension program that combines purchases of longer-term Treasury securities with sales of shorter-term Treasury securities. The objective of this program is to lengthen the average maturity of our securities holdings without generating a significant change in the size of our balance sheet. Removing longer-term securities from the market should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make financial market conditions more supportive of economic growth than they otherwise would have been. To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee also decided at its September meeting to reinvest principal received from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in agency MBS, rather than continuing to reinvest those proceeds in longer-term Treasury securities as had been the practice since August 2010. The Committee reviews the size and composition of its securities holdings regularly and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Before concluding, I would like to say a few words about the statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy that the FOMC issued at the conclusion of its January meeting. The statement reaffirms our commitment to our statutory objectives, given to us by the Congress, of price stability and maximum employment. Its purpose is to provide additional transparency and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. The statement does not imply a change in how the Committee conducts policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Transparency is enhanced by providing greater specificity about our objectives. Because the inflation rate over the longer run is determined primarily by monetary policy, it is feasible and appropriate for the Committee to set a numerical goal for that key variable. The FOMC judges that an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with its statutory mandate. While maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of monetary policy, the maximum level of employment in an economy is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market; it is therefore not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer-run level of employment. However, the Committee can estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inform policy decisions. In our most recent projections in January, for example, FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run, normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.8 As I noted a moment ago, the level of maximum employment in an economy is subject to change; for instance, it can be affected by shifts in the structure of the economy and by a range of economic policies. If at some stage the Committee estimated that the maximum level of employment had increased, for example, we would adjust monetary policy accordingly.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment are generally complementary. Indeed, at present, with the unemployment rate elevated and the inflation outlook subdued, the Committee judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives. However, in cases where these objectives are not complementary, the Committee follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitudes of the deviations of inflation and employment from levels judged to be consistent with the dual mandate, as well as the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to such levels.\"]\n"

      "[\"has continued to recover, but economic activity appears to have decelerated somewhat during the first half of this year. After rising at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the second half of 2011, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2012, and available indicators point to a still-smaller gain in the second quarter.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Conditions in the labor market improved during the latter part of 2011 and early this year, with the unemployment rate falling about a percentage point over that period. However, after running at nearly 200,000 per month during the fourth and first quarters, the average increase in payroll employment shrank to 75,000 per month during the second quarter. Issues related to seasonal adjustment and the unusually warm weather this past winter can account for a part, but only a part, of this loss of momentum in job creation. At the same time, the jobless rate has recently leveled out at just over 8 percent.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Household spending has continued to advance, but recent data indicate a somewhat slower rate of growth in the second quarter. Although declines in energy prices are now providing some support to consumers' purchasing power, households remain concerned about their employment and income prospects and their overall level of confidence remains relatively low.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We have seen modest signs of improvement in housing. In part because of historically low mortgage rates, both new and existing home sales have been gradually trending upward since last summer, and some measures of house prices have turned up in recent months. Construction has increased, especially in the multifamily sector. Still, a number of factors continue to impede progress in the housing market. On the demand side, many would-be buyers are deterred by worries about their own finances or about the economy more generally. Other prospective homebuyers cannot obtain mortgages due to tight lending standards, impaired creditworthiness, or because their current mortgages are underwater‑‑that is, they owe more than their homes are worth. On the supply side, the large number of vacant homes, boosted by the ongoing inflow of foreclosed properties, continues to divert demand from new construction.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       After posting strong gains over the second half of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, manufacturing production has slowed in recent months. Similarly, the rise in real business spending on equipment and software appears to have decelerated from the double-digit pace seen over the second half of 2011 to a more moderate rate of growth over the first part of this year. Forward-looking indicators of investment demand--such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans--suggest further weakness ahead. In part, slowing growth in production and capital investment appears to reflect economic stresses in Europe, which, together with some cooling in the economies of other trading partners, is restraining the demand for U.S. exports.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       At the time of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), my colleagues and I projected that, under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, economic growth will likely continue at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually. Specifically, our projections for growth in real GDP prepared for the meeting had a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.4 percent for this year and 2.2 to 2.8 percent for 2013.1 These forecasts are lower than those we made in January, reflecting the generally disappointing tone of the recent incoming data.2 In addition, financial strains associated with the crisis in Europe have increased since earlier in the year, which--as I already noted--are weighing on both global and domestic economic activity. The recovery in the United States continues to be held back by a number of other headwinds, including still-tight borrowing conditions for some businesses and households, and--as I will discuss in more detail shortly--the restraining effects of fiscal policy and fiscal uncertainty. Moreover, although the housing market has shown improvement, the contribution of this sector to the recovery is less than has been typical of previous recoveries. These headwinds should fade over time, allowing the economy to grow somewhat more rapidly and the unemployment rate to decline toward a more normal level. However, given that growth is projected to be not much above the rate needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force, the reduction in the unemployment rate seems likely to be frustratingly slow. Indeed, the central tendency of participants' forecasts now has the unemployment rate at 7 percent or higher at the end of 2014.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Committee made comparatively small changes in June to its projections for inflation. Over the first three months of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate, boosted by a large increase in retail energy prices that in turn reflected the higher cost of crude oil. However, the sharp drop in crude oil prices in the past few months has brought inflation down. In all, the PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent over the first five months of this year, compared with a 2-1/2 percent rise over 2011 as a whole. The central tendency of the Committee's projections is that inflation will be 1.2 to 1.7 percent this year, and at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges to be consistent with its statutory mandate in 2013 and 2014.\", \"June FOMC meeting indicated that they see a higher degree of uncertainty about their forecasts than normal and that the risks to economic growth have increased. I would like to highlight two main sources of risk: The first is the euro-area fiscal and banking crisis; the second is the U.S. fiscal situation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Earlier this year, financial strains in the euro area moderated in response to a number of constructive steps by the European authorities, including the provision of three-year bank financing by the European Central Bank. However, tensions in euro-area financial markets intensified again more recently, reflecting political uncertainties in Greece and news of losses at Spanish banks, which in turn raised questions about Spain's fiscal position and the resilience of the euro-area banking system more broadly. Euro-area authorities have responded by announcing a number of measures, including funding for the recapitalization of Spain's troubled banks, greater flexibility in the use of the European financial backstops (including, potentially, the flexibility to recapitalize banks directly rather than through loans to sovereigns), and movement toward unified supervision of euro-area banks. Even with these announcements, however, Europe's financial markets and economy remain under significant stress, with spillover effects on financial and economic conditions in the rest of the world, including the United States. Moreover, the possibility that the situation in Europe will worsen further remains a significant risk to the outlook.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve remains in close communication with our European counterparts. Although the politics are complex, we believe that the European authorities have both strong incentives and sufficient resources to resolve the crisis. At the same time, we have been focusing on improving the resilience of our financial system to severe shocks, including those that might emanate from Europe. The capital and liquidity positions of U.S. banking institutions have improved substantially in recent years, and we have been working with U.S. financial firms to ensure they are taking steps to manage the risks associated with their exposures to Europe. That said, European developments that resulted in a significant disruption in global financial markets would inevitably pose significant challenges for our financial system and our economy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The second important risk to our recovery, as I mentioned, is the domestic fiscal situation. As is well known, U.S. fiscal policies are on an unsustainable path, and the development of a credible medium-term plan for controlling deficits should be a high priority. At the same time, fiscal decisions should take into account the fragility of the recovery. That recovery could be endangered by the confluence of tax increases and spending reductions that will take effect early next year if no legislative action is taken. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, if the full range of tax increases and spending cuts were allowed to take effect--a scenario widely referred to as the fiscal cliff--a shallow recession would occur early next year and about 1-1/4 million fewer jobs would be created in 2013.3 These estimates do not incorporate the additional negative effects likely to result from public uncertainty about how these matters will be resolved. As you recall, market volatility spiked and confidence fell last summer, in part as a result of the protracted debate about the necessary increase in the debt ceiling. Similar effects could ensue as the debt ceiling and other difficult fiscal issues come into clearer view toward the end of this year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The most effective way that the Congress could help to support the economy right now would be to work to address the nation's fiscal challenges in a way that takes into account both the need for long-run sustainability and the fragility of the recovery. Doing so earlier rather than later would help reduce uncertainty and boost household and business confidence.\", \"weaker economic outlook, subdued projected path for inflation, and significant downside risks to economic growth, the FOMC decided to ease monetary policy at its June meeting by continuing its maturity extension program (or MEP) through the end of this year. The MEP combines sales of short-term Treasury securities with an equivalent amount of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. As a result, it decreases the supply of longer-term Treasury securities available to the public, putting upward pressure on the prices of those securities and downward pressure on their yields, without affecting the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. By removing additional longer-term Treasury securities from the market, the Fed's asset purchases also induce private investors to acquire other longer-term assets, such as corporate bonds and mortgage backed-securities, helping to raise their prices and lower their yields and thereby making broader financial conditions more accommodative.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Economic growth is also being supported by the exceptionally low level of the target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent and the Committee's forward guidance regarding the anticipated path of the funds rate. As I reported in my February testimony, the FOMC extended its forward guidance at its January meeting, noting that it expects that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee has maintained this conditional forward guidance at its subsequent meetings. Reflecting its concerns about the slow pace of progress in reducing unemployment and the downside risks to the economic outlook, the Committee made clear at its June meeting that it is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.\"]\n"

      "[\"stabilization of economic activity in mid-2009, the U.S. economy is now in its seventh quarter of growth; last quarter, for the first time in this expansion, our nation's real gross domestic product (GDP) matched its pre-crisis peak. Nevertheless, job growth remains relatively weak and the unemployment rate is still high.\\nIn its early stages, the economic recovery was largely attributable to the stabilization of the financial system, the effects of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and a strong boost to production from businesses rebuilding their depleted inventories. Economic growth slowed significantly in the spring and early summer of 2010, as the impetus from inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as Europe's debt problems roiled global financial markets. More recently, however, we have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold. Notably, real consumer spending has grown at a solid pace since last fall, and business investment in new equipment and software has continued to expand. Stronger demand, both domestic and foreign, has supported steady gains in U.S. manufacturing output.\\nThe combination of rising household and business confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and improving credit conditions seems likely to lead to a somewhat more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year. The most recent economic projections by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents, prepared in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in late January, are for real GDP to increase 3-1/2 to 4 percent in 2011, about one-half percentage point higher than our projections made in November.1 Private forecasters' projections for 2011 are broadly consistent with those of the FOMC participants and have also moved up in recent months.2\\xa0\\nWhile indicators of spending and production have been encouraging on balance, the job market has improved only slowly. Following the loss of about 8-3/4 million jobs from early 2008 through 2009, private-sector employment expanded by only a little more than 1 million during 2010, a gain barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates and other entrants to the labor force. We do see some grounds for optimism about the job market over the next few quarters, including notable declines in the unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new claims for unemployment insurance, and an improvement in firms' hiring plans. Even so, if the rate of economic growth remains moderate, as projected, it could be several years before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level. Indeed, FOMC participants generally see the unemployment rate still in the range of 7-1/2 to 8 percent at the end of 2012. Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.\\nLikewise, the housing sector remains exceptionally weak. The overhang of vacant and foreclosed houses is still weighing heavily on prices of new and existing homes, and sales and construction of new single-family homes remain depressed. Although mortgage rates are low and house prices have reached more affordable levels, many potential homebuyers are still finding mortgages difficult to obtain and remain concerned about possible further declines in home values.\\nInflation has declined, on balance, since the onset of the financial crisis, reflecting high levels of resource slack and stable longer-term inflation expectations. Indeed, over the 12 months ending in January, prices for all of the goods and services consumed by households (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)) increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.5 percent in the year-earlier period. Wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly earnings increasing only 1.9 percent over the year ending in January. In combination with productivity increases, slow wage growth has implied very tight restraint on labor costs per unit of output.\\nFOMC participants see inflation remaining low; most project that overall inflation will be about 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent this year and in the range of 1 to 2 percent next year and in 2013. Private-sector forecasters generally also anticipate subdued inflation over the next few years.3 Measures of medium- and long-term inflation compensation derived from inflation-indexed Treasury bonds appear broadly consistent with these forecasts. Surveys of households suggest that the public's longer-term inflation expectations also remain stable.\\nAlthough overall inflation is low, since summer we have seen significant increases in some highly visible prices, including those of gasoline and other commodities. Notably, in the past few weeks, concerns about unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and the possible effects on global oil supplies have led oil and gasoline prices to rise further. More broadly, the increases in commodity prices in recent months have largely reflected rising global demand for raw materials, particularly in some fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled with constraints on global supply in some cases. Commodity prices have risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar are unlikely to have been an important driver of the increases seen in recent months.\\nThe rate of pass-through from commodity price increases to broad indexes of U.S. consumer prices has been quite low in recent decades, partly reflecting the relatively small weight of materials inputs in total production costs as well as the stability of longer-term inflation expectations. Currently, the cost pressures from higher commodity prices are also being offset by the stability in unit labor costs. Thus, the most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation--an outlook consistent with the projections of both FOMC participants and most private forecasters. That said, sustained rises in the prices of oil or other commodities would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored. We will continue to monitor these developments closely and are prepared to respond as necessary to best support the ongoing recovery in a context of price stability.\", \"the pace of recovery slowed last spring--to a rate that, if sustained, would have been insufficient to make meaningful progress against unemployment. With job creation stalling, concerns about the sustainability of the recovery increased. At the same time, inflation--already at very low levels--continued to drift downward, and market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower as investors appeared to become more concerned about the possibility of deflation, or falling prices.4\\xa0\\nUnder such conditions, the Federal Reserve would normally ease monetary policy by reducing the target for its short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate. However, the target range for the federal funds rate has been near zero since December 2008, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low target rate for an extended period. Consequently, another means of providing monetary accommodation has been necessary since that time. In particular, over the past two years the Federal Reserve has eased monetary conditions by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on the open market. The largest program of purchases, which lasted from December 2008 through March 2010, appears to have contributed to an improvement in financial conditions and a strengthening of the recovery. Notably, the substantial expansion of the program announced in March 2009 was followed by financial and economic stabilization and a significant pickup in the growth of economic activity in the second half of that year.\\nIn August 2010, in response to the already-mentioned concerns about the sustainability of the recovery and the continuing declines in inflation to very low levels, the FOMC authorized a policy of reinvesting principal payments on our holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into longer-term Treasury securities. By reinvesting agency securities, rather than allowing them to continue to run off as our previous policy had dictated, the FOMC ensured that a high level of monetary accommodation would be maintained. Over subsequent weeks, Federal Reserve officials noted in public remarks that we were considering providing additional monetary accommodation through further asset purchases. In November, the Committee announced that it intended to purchase an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year.\\nLarge-scale purchases of longer-term securities are a less familiar means of providing monetary policy stimulus than reducing the federal funds rate, but the two approaches affect the economy in similar ways. Conventional monetary policy easing works by lowering market expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, reduces the current level of longer-term interest rates and contributes to both lower borrowing costs and higher asset prices. This easing in financial conditions bolsters household and business spending and thus increases economic activity. By comparison, the Federal Reserve's purchases of longer-term securities, by lowering term premiums, put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates. By easing conditions in credit and financial markets, these actions encourage spending by households and businesses through essentially the same channels as conventional monetary policy.\\nA wide range of market indicators supports the view that the Federal Reserve's recent actions have been effective. For example, since August, when we announced our policy of reinvesting principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS and indicated that we were considering more securities purchases, equity prices have risen significantly, volatility in the equity market has fallen, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities has risen to historically more normal levels. Yields on 5- to 10-year nominal Treasury securities initially declined markedly as markets priced in prospective Fed purchases; these yields subsequently rose, however, as investors became more optimistic about economic growth and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases. All of these developments are what one would expect to see when monetary policy becomes more accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means. Interestingly, these market responses are almost identical to those that occurred during the earlier episode of policy easing, notably in the months following our March 2009 announcement. In addition, as I already noted, most forecasters see the economic outlook as having improved since our actions in August; downside risks to the recovery have receded, and the risk of deflation has become negligible. Of course, it is too early to make any firm judgment about how much of the recent improvement in the outlook can be attributed to monetary policy, but these developments are consistent with it having had a beneficial effect.\\nMy colleagues and I continue to regularly review the asset purchase program in light of incoming information, and we will adjust it as needed to promote the achievement of our mandate from the Congress of maximum employment and stable prices. We also continue to plan for the eventual exit from unusually accommodative monetary policies and the normalization of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. We have all the tools we need to achieve a smooth and effective exit at the appropriate time. Currently, because the Federal Reserve's asset purchases are settled through the banking system, depository institutions hold a very high level of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve. Even if bank reserves remain high, however, our ability to pay interest on reserve balances will allow us to put upward pressure on short-term market interest rates and thus to tighten monetary policy when required. Moreover, we have developed and tested additional tools that will allow us to drain or immobilize bank reserves to the extent needed to tighten the relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates.5 If necessary, the Federal Reserve can also drain reserves by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on the securities it holds or by selling some of those securities in the open market. The FOMC remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and, in particular, to achieving a rate of inflation in the medium term that is consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate.\", \"the Federal Reserve, set its monetary policy objectives, and provided it with operational independence to pursue those objectives. The Federal Reserve's operational independence is critical, as it allows the FOMC to make monetary policy decisions based solely on the longer-term needs of the economy, not in response to short-term political pressures. Considerable evidence supports the view that countries with independent central banks enjoy better economic performance over time.6\\xa0\\nHowever, in our democratic society, the Federal Reserve's independence brings with it the obligation to be accountable and transparent. The Congress and the public must have all the information needed to understand our decisions, to be assured of the integrity of our operations, and to be confident that our actions are consistent with the mandate given to us by the Congress.\\nOn matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is one of the most transparent central banks in the world, making available extensive records and materials to explain its policy decisions. For example, beyond the semiannual Monetary Policy Report I am presenting today, the FOMC provides a post-meeting statement, a detailed set of minutes three weeks after each policy meeting, quarterly economic projections together with an accompanying narrative, and, with a five-year lag, a transcript of each meeting and its supporting materials. In addition, FOMC participants often discuss the economy and monetary policy in public forums, and Board members testify frequently before the Congress.\\nIn recent years the Federal Reserve has also substantially increased the information it provides about its operations and its balance sheet. In particular, for some time the Federal Reserve has been voluntarily providing extensive financial and operational information regarding the special credit and liquidity facilities put in place during the financial crisis, including full descriptions of the terms and conditions of each facility; monthly reports on, among other things, the types of collateral posted and the mix of participants using each facility; weekly updates about borrowings and repayments at each facility; and many other details.7 Further, on December 1, as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Reserve Board posted on its public website the details of more than 21,000 individual credit and other transactions conducted to stabilize markets and support the economic recovery during the crisis. This transaction-level information demonstrated the breadth of these operations and the care that was taken to protect the interests of the taxpayer; indeed, despite the scope of these actions, the Federal Reserve has incurred no credit losses to date on any of the programs and expects no credit losses in any of the few programs that still have loans outstanding. Moreover, we are fully confident that independent assessments of these programs will show that they were highly effective in helping to stabilize financial markets, thus strengthening the economy. Overall, the operational effectiveness of the programs was recently supported as part of a comprehensive review of six lending facilities by the Board's independent Office of Inspector General.8 In addition, we have been working closely with the Government Accountability Office, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congressional Oversight Panel, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on reviews of these facilities as well as a range of matters relating to the Federal Reserve's operations and governance. We will continue to seek ways of enhancing our transparency without compromising our ability to conduct policy in the public interest.\"]\n"

      "[\"has continued to recover, but the pace of the expansion so far this year has been modest. After increasing at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the second half of 2010, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at about a 2 percent rate in the first quarter of this year, and incoming data suggest that the pace of recovery remained soft in the spring. At the same time, the unemployment rate, which had appeared to be on a downward trajectory at the turn of the year, has moved back above 9 percent.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In part, the recent weaker-than-expected economic performance appears to have been the result of several factors that are likely to be temporary. Notably, the run-up in prices of energy, especially gasoline, and food has reduced consumer purchasing power. In addition, the supply chain disruptions that occurred following the earthquake in Japan caused U.S. motor vehicle producers to sharply curtail assemblies and limited the availability of some models. Looking forward, however, the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities should ease the pressure on household budgets, and vehicle manufacturers report that they are making significant progress in overcoming the parts shortages and expect to increase production substantially this summer.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In light of these developments, the most recent projections by members of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, prepared in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in late June, reflected their assessment that the pace of the economic recovery will pick up in coming quarters. Specifically, participants' projections for the increase in real GDP have a central tendency of 2.7 to 2.9 percent for 2011, inclusive of the weak first half, and 3.3 to 3.7 percent in 2012--projections that, if realized, would constitute a notably better performance than we have seen so far this year.1\\n\\n\\r\\n       FOMC participants continued to see the economic recovery strengthening over the medium term, with the central tendency of their projections for the increase in real GDP picking up to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2013. At the same time, the central tendencies of the projections of real GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 were marked down nearly 1/2 percentage point compared with those reported in April, suggesting that FOMC participants saw at least some part of the first-half slowdown as persisting for a while. Among the headwinds facing the economy are the slow growth in consumer spending, even after accounting for the effects of higher food and energy prices; the continuing depressed condition of the housing sector; still-limited access to credit for some households and small businesses; and fiscal tightening at all levels of government. Consistent with projected growth in real output modestly above its trend rate, FOMC participants expected that, over time, the jobless rate will decline--albeit only slowly--toward its longer-term normal level. The central tendencies of participants' forecasts for the unemployment rate were 8.6 to 8.9 percent for the fourth quarter of this year, 7.8 to 8.2 percent at the end of 2012, and 7.0 to 7.5 percent at the end of 2013.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The most recent data attest to the continuing weakness of the labor market: The unemployment rate increased to 9.2 percent in June, and gains in nonfarm payroll employment were below expectations for a second month. To date, of the more than 8-1/2 million jobs lost in the recession, 1-3/4 million have been regained. Of those employed, about 6 percent--8.6 million workers--report that they would like to be working full time but can only obtain part‑time work. Importantly, nearly half of those currently unemployed have been out of work for more than six months, by far the highest ratio in the post-World War II period. Long-term unemployment imposes severe economic hardships on the unemployed and their families, and, by leading to an erosion of skills of those without work, it both impairs their lifetime employment prospects and reduces the productive potential of our economy as a whole.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Much of the slowdown in aggregate demand this year has been centered in the household sector, and the ability and willingness of consumers to spend will be an important determinant of the pace of the recovery in coming quarters. Real disposable personal income over the first five months of 2011 was boosted by the reduction in payroll taxes, but those gains were largely offset by higher prices for gasoline and other commodities. Households report that they have little confidence in the durability of the recovery and about their own income prospects. Moreover, the ongoing weakness in home values is holding down household wealth and weighing on consumer sentiment. On the positive side, household debt burdens are declining, delinquency rates on credit card and auto loans are down significantly, and the number of homeowners missing a mortgage payment for the first time is decreasing. The anticipated pickups in economic activity and job creation, together with the expected easing of price pressures, should bolster real household income, confidence, and spending in the medium run.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Residential construction activity remains at an extremely low level. The demand for homes has been depressed by many of the same factors that have held down consumer spending more generally, including the slowness of the recovery in jobs and income as well as poor consumer sentiment. Mortgage interest rates are near record lows, but access to mortgage credit continues to be constrained. Also, many potential homebuyers remain concerned about buying into a falling market, as weak demand for homes, the substantial backlog of vacant properties for sale, and the high proportion of distressed sales are keeping downward pressure on house prices.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Two bright spots in the recovery have been exports and business investment in equipment and software. Demand for U.S.-made capital goods from both domestic and foreign firms has supported manufacturing production throughout the recovery thus far. Both equipment and software outlays and exports increased solidly in the first quarter, and the data on new orders received by U.S. producers suggest that the trend continued in recent months. Corporate profits have been strong, and larger nonfinancial corporations with access to capital markets have been able to refinance existing debt and lock in funding at lower yields. Borrowing conditions for businesses generally have continued to ease, although, as mentioned, the availability of credit appears to remain relatively limited for some small firms.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation has picked up so far this year. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at an annual rate of more than 4 percent over the first five months of 2011, and 2-1/2 percent on a 12-month basis. Much of the acceleration was the result of higher prices for oil and other commodities and for imported goods. In addition, prices of motor vehicles increased sharply when supplies of new models were curtailed by parts shortages associated with the earthquake in Japan. Most of the recent rise in inflation appears likely to be transitory, and FOMC participants expected inflation to subside in coming quarters to rates at or below the level of 2 percent or a bit less that participants view as consistent with our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. The central tendency of participants' forecasts for the rate of increase in the PCE price index was 2.3 to 2.5 percent for 2011 as a whole, which implies a significant slowing of inflation in the second half of the year. In 2012 and 2013, the central tendency of the inflation forecasts was 1.5 to 2.0 percent. Reasons to expect inflation to moderate include the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities, which is already showing through to retail gasoline and food prices; the still-substantial slack in U.S. labor and product markets, which has made it difficult for workers to obtain wage gains and for firms to pass through their higher costs; and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by surveys of households, the forecasts of professional private-sector economists, and financial market indicators.\", \"that the pace of the economic recovery over coming quarters will likely remain moderate, that the unemployment rate will consequently decline only gradually, and that inflation will subside are the basis for the Committee's decision to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy. As you know, that policy currently consists of two parts. First, the target range for the federal funds rate remains at 0 to 1/4 percent and, as indicated in the statement released after the June meeting, the Committee expects that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The second component of monetary policy has been to increase the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities, an approach undertaken because the target for the federal funds rate could not be lowered meaningfully further. The Federal Reserve's acquisition of longer-term Treasury securities boosted the prices of such securities and caused longer-term Treasury yields to be lower than they would have been otherwise. In addition, by removing substantial quantities of longer-term Treasury securities from the market, the Fed's purchases induced private investors to acquire other assets that serve as substitutes for Treasury securities in the financial marketplace, such as corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. By this means, the Fed's asset purchase program--like more conventional monetary policy--has served to reduce the yields and increase the prices of those other assets as well. The net result of these actions is lower borrowing costs and easier financial conditions throughout the economy.2 We know from many decades of experience with monetary policy that, when the economy is operating below its potential, easier financial conditions tend to promote more rapid economic growth. Estimates based on a number of recent studies as well as Federal Reserve analyses suggest that, all else being equal, the second round of asset purchases probably lowered longer-term interest rates approximately 10 to 30 basis points.3 Our analysis further indicates that a reduction in longer-term interest rates of this magnitude would be roughly equivalent in terms of its effect on the economy to a 40 to 120 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In June, we completed the planned purchases of $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities that the Committee initiated in November, while continuing to reinvest the proceeds of maturing or redeemed longer-term securities in Treasuries. Although we are no longer expanding our securities holdings, the evidence suggests that the degree of accommodation delivered by the Federal Reserve's securities purchase program is determined primarily by the quantity and mix of securities that the Federal Reserve holds rather than by the current pace of new purchases. Thus, even with the end of net new purchases, maintaining our holdings of these securities should continue to put downward pressure on market interest rates and foster more accommodative financial conditions than would otherwise be the case. It is worth emphasizing that our program involved purchases of securities, not government spending, and, as I will discuss later, when the macroeconomic circumstances call for it, we will unwind those purchases. In the meantime, interest on those securities is remitted to the U.S. Treasury.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       When we began this program, we certainly did not expect it to be a panacea for the country's economic problems. However, as the expansion weakened last summer, developments with respect to both components of our dual mandate implied that additional monetary accommodation was needed. In that context, we believed that the program would both help reduce the risk of deflation that had emerged and provide a needed boost to faltering economic activity and job creation. The experience to date with the round of securities purchases that just ended suggests that the program had the intended effects of reducing the risk of deflation and shoring up economic activity. In the months following the August announcement of our policy of reinvesting maturing and redeemed securities and our signal that we were considering more purchases, inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities rose from low to more normal levels, suggesting that the perceived risks of deflation had receded markedly. This was a significant achievement, as we know from the Japanese experience that protracted deflation can be quite costly in terms of weaker economic growth.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       With respect to employment, our expectations were relatively modest; estimates made in the autumn suggested that the additional purchases could boost employment by about 700,000 jobs over two years, or about 30,000 extra jobs per month.4 Even including the disappointing readings for May and June, which reflected in part the temporary factors discussed earlier, private payroll gains have averaged 160,000 per month in the first half of 2011, compared with average increases of only about 80,000 private jobs per month from May to August 2010. Not all of the step-up in hiring was necessarily the result of the asset purchase program, but the comparison is consistent with our expectations for employment gains. Of course, we will be monitoring developments in the labor market closely.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Once the temporary shocks that have been holding down economic activity pass, we expect to again see the effects of policy accommodation reflected in stronger economic activity and job creation. However, given the range of uncertainties about the strength of the recovery and prospects for inflation over the medium term, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to respond should economic developments indicate that an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       On the one hand, the possibility remains that the recent economic weakness may prove more persistent than expected and that deflationary risks might reemerge, implying a need for additional policy support. Even with the federal funds rate close to zero, we have a number of ways in which we could act to ease financial conditions further. One option would be to provide more explicit guidance about the period over which the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would remain at their current levels. Another approach would be to initiate more securities purchases or to increase the average maturity of our holdings. The Federal Reserve could also reduce the 25 basis point rate of interest it pays to banks on their reserves, thereby putting downward pressure on short-term rates more generally. Of course, our experience with these policies remains relatively limited, and employing them would entail potential risks and costs. However, prudent planning requires that we evaluate the efficacy of these and other potential alternatives for deploying additional stimulus if conditions warrant.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       On the other hand, the economy could evolve in a way that would warrant a move toward less-accommodative policy. Accordingly, the Committee has been giving careful consideration to the elements of its exit strategy, and, as reported in the minutes of the June FOMC meeting, it has reached a broad consensus about the sequence of steps that it expects to follow when the normalization of policy becomes appropriate. In brief, when economic conditions warrant, the Committee would begin the normalization process by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on its securities, thereby allowing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to begin shrinking. At the same time or sometime thereafter, the Committee would modify the forward guidance in its statement. Subsequent steps would include the initiation of temporary reserve-draining operations and, when conditions warrant, increases in the federal funds rate target. From that point on, changing the level or range of the federal funds rate target would be our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Sometime after the first increase in the federal funds rate target, the Committee expects to initiate sales of agency securities from its portfolio, with the timing and pace of sales clearly communicated to the public in advance. Once sales begin, the pace of sales is anticipated to be relatively gradual and steady, but it could be adjusted up or down in response to material changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions. Over time, the securities portfolio and the associated quantity of bank reserves are expected to be reduced to the minimum levels consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy. Of course, conditions can change, and in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that process, should that be the next direction for policy, we would carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate.\"]\n"

      "[\"recession officially began more than two years ago, U.S. economic activity contracted particularly sharply following the intensification of the global financial crisis in the fall of 2008. Concerted efforts by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and other U.S. authorities to stabilize the financial system, together with highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, helped arrest the decline and are supporting a nascent economic recovery. Indeed, the U.S. economy expanded at about a 4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. A significant portion of that growth, however, can be attributed to the progress firms made in working down unwanted inventories of unsold goods, which left them more willing to increase production. As the impetus provided by the inventory cycle is temporary, and as the fiscal support for economic growth likely will diminish later this year, a sustained recovery will depend on continued growth in private-sector final demand for goods and services.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Private final demand does seem to be growing at a moderate pace, buoyed in part by a general improvement in financial conditions. In particular, consumer spending has recently picked up, reflecting gains in real disposable income and household wealth and tentative signs of stabilization in the labor market. Business investment in equipment and software has risen significantly. And international trade--supported by a recovery in the economies of many of our trading partners--is rebounding from its deep contraction of a year ago. However, starts of single-family homes, which rose noticeably this past spring, have recently been roughly flat, and commercial construction is declining sharply, reflecting poor fundamentals and continued difficulty in obtaining financing.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The job market has been hit especially hard by the recession, as employers reacted to sharp sales declines and concerns about credit availability by deeply cutting their workforces in late 2008 and in 2009. Some recent indicators suggest the deterioration in the labor market is abating: Job losses have slowed considerably, and the number of full-time jobs in manufacturing rose modestly in January. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to trend lower, and the temporary services industry, often considered a bellwether for the employment outlook, has been expanding steadily since October. Notwithstanding these positive signs, the job market remains quite weak, with the unemployment rate near 10 percent and job openings scarce. Of particular concern, because of its long-term implications for workers' skills and wages, is the increasing incidence of long-term unemployment; indeed, more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or more, nearly double the share of a year ago.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Increases in energy prices resulted in a pickup in consumer price inflation in the second half of last year, but oil prices have flattened out over recent months, and most indicators suggest that inflation likely will be subdued for some time. Slack in labor and product markets has reduced wage and price pressures in most markets, and sharp increases in productivity have further reduced producers' unit labor costs. The cost of shelter, which receives a heavy weight in consumer price indexes, is rising very slowly, reflecting high vacancy rates. In addition, according to most measures, longer-term inflation expectations have remained relatively stable.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The improvement in financial markets that began last spring continues. Conditions in short-term funding markets have returned to near pre-crisis levels. Many (mostly larger) firms have been able to issue corporate bonds or new equity and do not seem to be hampered by a lack of credit. In contrast, bank lending continues to contract, reflecting both tightened lending standards and weak demand for credit amid uncertain economic prospects.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In conjunction with the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The contours of these forecasts are broadly similar to those I reported to the Congress last July. FOMC participants continue to anticipate a moderate pace of economic recovery, with economic growth of roughly 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010 and 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in 2011. Consistent with moderate economic growth, participants expect the unemployment rate to decline only slowly, to a range of roughly 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent by the end of 2012, still well above their estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of about 5 percent. Inflation is expected to remain subdued, with consumer prices rising at rates between 1 and 2 percent in 2010 through 2012. In the longer term, inflation is expected to be between 1-3/4 and 2 percent, the range that most FOMC participants judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\", \"the Federal Reserve has employed a wide array of tools to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability. The target for the federal funds rate has been maintained at a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent since December 2008. The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. We have been gradually slowing the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipate that these transactions will be completed by the end of March. The FOMC will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In response to the substantial improvements in the functioning of most financial markets, the Federal Reserve is winding down the special liquidity facilities it created during the crisis. On February 1, a number of these facilities, including credit facilities for primary dealers, lending programs intended to help stabilize money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market, and temporary liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks, were allowed to expire.1 The only remaining lending program for multiple borrowers created under the Federal Reserve's emergency authorities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on March 31 for loans backed by all types of collateral except newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and on June 30 for loans backed by newly issued CMBS.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to closing its special facilities, the Federal Reserve is normalizing its lending to commercial banks through the discount window. The final auction of discount-window funds to depositories through the Term Auction Facility, which was created in the early stages of the crisis to improve the liquidity of the banking system, will occur on March 8. Last week we announced that the maximum term of discount window loans, which was increased to as much as 90 days during the crisis, would be returned to overnight for most banks, as it was before the crisis erupted in August 2007. To discourage banks from relying on the discount window rather than private funding markets for short-term credit, last week we also increased the discount rate by 25 basis points, raising the spread between the discount rate and the top of the target range for the federal funds rate to 50 basis points. These changes, like the closure of most of the special lending facilities earlier this month, are in response to the improved functioning of financial markets, which has reduced the need for extraordinary assistance from the Federal Reserve. These adjustments are not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for households and businesses and should not be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy, which remains about the same as it was at the time of the January meeting of the FOMC.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Although the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as the expansion matures, the Federal Reserve will at some point need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding the substantial increase in the size of its balance sheet associated with its purchases of Treasury and agency securities, we are confident that we have the tools we need to firm the stance of monetary policy at the appropriate time.2\\n\\n\\r\\n       Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave statutory authority to the Federal Reserve to pay interest on banks' holdings of reserve balances at Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in longer-term interest rates and in financial conditions more generally.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve has also been developing a number of additional tools to reduce the large quantity of reserves held by the banking system, which will improve the Federal Reserve's control of financial conditions by leading to a tighter relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates. Notably, our operational capacity for conducting reverse repurchase agreements, a tool that the Federal Reserve has historically used to absorb reserves from the banking system, is being expanded so that such transactions can be used to absorb large quantities of reserves.3 The Federal Reserve is also currently refining plans for a term deposit facility that could convert a portion of depository institutions' holdings of reserve balances into deposits that are less liquid and could not be used to meet reserve requirements.4 In addition, the FOMC has the option of redeeming or selling securities as a means of reducing outstanding bank reserves and applying monetary restraint. Of course, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments. I provided more discussion of these options and possible sequencing in a recent testimony.5\", \"to ensuring that the Congress and the public have all the information needed to understand our decisions and to be assured of the integrity of our operations. Indeed, on matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is already one of the most transparent central banks in the world, providing detailed records and explanations of its decisions. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve also took a number of steps to enhance the transparency of its special credit and liquidity facilities, including the provision of regular, extensive reports to the Congress and the public; and we have worked closely with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on a range of matters relating to these facilities.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       While the emergency credit and liquidity facilities were important tools for implementing monetary policy during the crisis, we understand that the unusual nature of those facilities creates a special obligation to assure the Congress and the public of the integrity of their operation. Accordingly, we would welcome a review by the GAO of the Federal Reserve's management of all facilities created under emergency authorities.6 In particular, we would support legislation authorizing the GAO to audit the operational integrity, collateral policies, use of third-party contractors, accounting, financial reporting, and internal controls of these special credit and liquidity facilities. The Federal Reserve will, of course, cooperate fully and actively in all reviews. We are also prepared to support legislation that would require the release of the identities of the firms that participated in each special facility after an appropriate delay. It is important that the release occur after a lag that is sufficiently long that investors will not view an institution's use of one of the facilities as a possible indication of ongoing financial problems, thereby undermining market confidence in the institution or discouraging use of any future facility that might become necessary to protect the U.S. economy. An appropriate delay would also allow firms adequate time to inform investors through annual reports and other public documents of their use of Federal Reserve facilities.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Looking ahead, we will continue to work with the Congress in identifying approaches for enhancing the Federal Reserve's transparency that are consistent with our statutory objectives of fostering maximum employment and price stability. In particular, it is vital that the conduct of monetary policy continue to be insulated from short-term political pressures so that the FOMC can make policy decisions in the longer-term economic interests of the American people. Moreover, the confidentiality of discount window lending to individual depository institutions must be maintained so that the Federal Reserve continues to have effective ways to provide liquidity to depository institutions under circumstances where other sources of funding are not available. The Federal Reserve's ability to inject liquidity into the financial system is critical for preserving financial stability and for supporting depositories' key role in meeting the ongoing credit needs of firms and households.\", \"regulatory system is essential for the long-term economic stability of the nation. Among the lessons of the crisis are the crucial importance of macroprudential regulation--that is, regulation and supervision aimed at addressing risks to the financial system as a whole--and the need for effective consolidated supervision of every financial institution that is so large or interconnected that its failure could threaten the functioning of the entire financial system.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve strongly supports the Congress's ongoing efforts to achieve comprehensive financial reform. In the meantime, to strengthen the Federal Reserve's oversight of banking organizations, we have been conducting an intensive self-examination of our regulatory and supervisory responsibilities and have been actively implementing improvements. For example, the Federal Reserve has been playing a key role in international efforts to toughen capital and liquidity requirements for financial institutions, particularly systemically critical firms, and we have been taking the lead in ensuring that compensation structures at banking organizations provide appropriate incentives without encouraging excessive risk-taking.7\\n\\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve is also making fundamental changes in its supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, both to improve the effectiveness of consolidated supervision and to incorporate a macroprudential perspective that goes beyond the traditional focus on safety and soundness of individual institutions. We are overhauling our supervisory framework and procedures to improve coordination within our own supervisory staff and with other supervisory agencies and to facilitate more-integrated assessments of risks within each holding company and across groups of companies.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Last spring the Federal Reserve led the successful Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, popularly known as the bank stress tests. An important lesson of that program was that combining on-site bank examinations with a suite of quantitative and analytical tools can greatly improve comparability of the results and better identify potential risks. In that spirit, the Federal Reserve is also in the process of developing an enhanced quantitative surveillance program for large bank holding companies. Supervisory information will be combined with firm-level, market-based indicators and aggregate economic data to provide a more complete picture of the risks facing these institutions and the broader financial system. Making use of the Federal Reserve's unparalleled breadth of expertise, this program will apply a multidisciplinary approach that involves economists, specialists in particular financial markets, payments systems experts, and other professionals, as well as bank supervisors.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The recent crisis has also underscored the extent to which direct involvement in the oversight of banks and bank holding companies contributes to the Federal Reserve's effectiveness in carrying out its responsibilities as a central bank, including the making of monetary policy and the management of the discount window. Most important, as the crisis has once again demonstrated, the Federal Reserve's ability to identify and address diverse and hard-to-predict threats to financial stability depends critically on the information, expertise, and powers that it has by virtue of being both a bank supervisor and a central bank.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve continues to demonstrate its commitment to strengthening consumer protections in the financial services arena. Since the time of the previous Monetary Policy Report in July, the Federal Reserve has proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing consumer mortgage transactions, and we are collaborating with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assess how we might further increase transparency in the mortgage process.8 We have issued rules implementing enhanced consumer protections for credit card accounts and private student loans as well as new rules to ensure that consumers have meaningful opportunities to avoid overdraft fees.9 In addition, the Federal Reserve has implemented an expanded consumer compliance supervision program for nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations.10\\n\\n\\r\\n       More generally, the Federal Reserve is committed to doing all that can be done to ensure that our economy is never again devastated by a financial collapse. We look forward to working with the Congress to develop effective and comprehensive reform of the\"]\n"

      "[\"expansion that began in the middle of last year is proceeding at a moderate pace, supported by stimulative monetary and fiscal policies. Although fiscal policy and inventory restocking will likely be providing less impetus to the recovery than they have in recent quarters, rising demand from households and businesses should help sustain growth. In particular, real consumer spending appears to have expanded at about a 2-1/2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year, with purchases of durable goods increasing especially rapidly. However, the housing market remains weak, with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home prices and construction.\\nAn important drag on household spending is the slow recovery in the labor market and the attendant uncertainty about job prospects. After two years of job losses, private payrolls expanded at an average of about 100,000 per month during the first half of this year, a pace insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially. In all likelihood, a significant amount of time will be required to restore the nearly 8-1/2 million jobs that were lost over 2008 and 2009. Moreover, nearly half of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than six months. Long-term unemployment not only imposes exceptional near-term hardships on workers and their families, it also erodes skills and may have long-lasting effects on workers' employment and earnings prospects.\\nIn the business sector, investment in equipment and software appears to have increased rapidly in the first half of the year, in part reflecting capital outlays that had been deferred during the downturn and the need of many businesses to replace aging equipment. In contrast, spending on nonresidential structures--weighed down by high vacancy rates and tight credit--has continued to contract, though some indicators suggest that the rate of decline may be slowing. Both U.S. exports and U.S. imports have been expanding, reflecting growth in the global economy and the recovery of world trade. Stronger exports have in turn helped foster growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\\nInflation has remained low. The price index for personal consumption expenditures appears to have risen at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of the year. Although overall inflation has fluctuated, partly reflecting changes in energy prices, by a number of measures underlying inflation has trended down over the past two years. The slack in labor and product markets has damped wage and price pressures, and rapid increases in productivity have further reduced producers' unit labor costs.\\nMy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I expect continued moderate growth, a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, and subdued inflation over the next several years. In conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared forecasts of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The forecasts are qualitatively similar to those we released in February and May, although progress in reducing unemployment is now expected to be somewhat slower than we previously projected, and near-term inflation now looks likely to be a little lower. Most FOMC participants expect real GDP growth of 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010, and roughly 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in 2011 and 2012. The unemployment rate is expected to decline to between 7 and 7-1/2 percent by the end of 2012. Most participants viewed uncertainty about the outlook for growth and unemployment as greater than normal, and the majority saw the risks to growth as weighted to the downside. Most participants projected that inflation will average only about 1 percent in 2010 and that it will remain low during 2011 and 2012, with the risks to the inflation outlook roughly balanced.\\nOne factor underlying the Committee's somewhat weaker outlook is that financial conditions--though much improved since the depth of the financial crisis--have become less supportive of economic growth in recent months. Notably, concerns about the ability of Greece and a number of other euro-area countries to manage their sizable budget deficits and high levels of public debt spurred a broad-based withdrawal from risk-taking in global financial markets in the spring, resulting in lower stock prices and wider risk spreads in the United States. In response to these fiscal pressures, European leaders put in place a number of strong measures, including an assistance package for Greece and €500 billion of funding to backstop the near-term financing needs of euro-area countries. To help ease strains in U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve reestablished temporary dollar liquidity swap lines with the ECB and several other major central banks. To date, drawings under the swap lines have been limited, but we believe that the existence of these lines has increased confidence in dollar funding markets, helping to maintain credit availability in our own financial system.\\nLike financial conditions generally, the state of the U.S. banking system has also improved significantly since the worst of the crisis. Loss rates on most types of loans seem to be peaking, and, in the aggregate, bank capital ratios have risen to new highs. However, many banks continue to have a large volume of troubled loans on their books, and bank lending standards remain tight. With credit demand weak and with banks writing down problem credits, bank loans outstanding have continued to contract. Small businesses, which depend importantly on bank credit, have been particularly hard hit. At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to facilitate the flow of funds to creditworthy small businesses. Along with the other supervisory agencies, we issued guidance to banks and examiners emphasizing that lenders should do all they can to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, including small businesses.1 We also have conducted extensive training programs for our bank examiners, with the message that lending to viable small businesses is good for the safety and soundness of our banking system as well as for our economy. We continue to seek feedback from both banks and potential borrowers about credit conditions. For example, over the past six months we have convened more than 40 meetings around the country of lenders, small business representatives, bank examiners, government officials, and other stakeholders to exchange ideas about the challenges faced by small businesses, particularly in obtaining credit. A capstone conference on addressing the credit needs of small businesses was held at the Board of Governors in Washington last week.2 This testimony includes an addendum that summarizes the findings of this effort and possible next steps.\", \"response to the financial crisis and the recession has involved several components. First, in response to the periods of intense illiquidity and dysfunction in financial markets that characterized the crisis, the Federal Reserve undertook a range of measures and set up emergency programs designed to provide liquidity to financial institutions and markets in the form of fully secured, mostly short-term loans. Over time, these programs helped to stem the panic and to restore normal functioning in a number of key financial markets, supporting the flow of credit to the economy. As financial markets stabilized, the Federal Reserve shut down most of these programs during the first half of this year and took steps to normalize the terms on which it lends to depository institutions. The only such programs currently open to provide new liquidity are the recently reestablished dollar liquidity swap lines with major central banks that I noted earlier. Importantly, our broad-based programs achieved their intended purposes with no loss to taxpayers. All of the loans extended through the multiborrower facilities that have come due have been repaid in full, with interest. In addition, the Board does not expect the Federal Reserve to incur a net loss on any of the secured loans provided during the crisis to help prevent the disorderly failure of systemically significant financial institutions.\\nA second major component of the Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis and recession has involved both standard and less conventional forms of monetary policy. Over the course of the crisis, the FOMC aggressively reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, which has been maintained since the end of 2008. And, as indicated in the statement released after the June meeting, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.3\\nIn addition to the very low federal funds rate, the FOMC has provided monetary policy stimulus through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, federal agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). A range of evidence suggests that these purchases helped improve conditions in mortgage markets and other private credit markets and put downward pressure on longer-term private borrowing rates and spreads.\\nCompared with the period just before the financial crisis, the System's portfolio of domestic securities has increased from about $800 billion to $2 trillion and has shifted from consisting of 100 percent Treasury securities to having almost two-thirds of its investments in agency-related securities. In addition, the average maturity of the Treasury portfolio nearly doubled, from three and one-half years to almost seven years. The FOMC plans to return the System's portfolio to a more normal size and composition over the longer term, and the Committee has been discussing alternative approaches to accomplish that objective.\\nOne approach is for the Committee to adjust its reinvestment policy--that is, its policy for handling repayments of principal on the securities--to gradually normalize the portfolio over time. Currently, repayments of principal from agency debt and MBS are not being reinvested, allowing the holdings of those securities to run off as the repayments are received. By contrast, the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities are being reinvested in new issues of Treasury securities with similar maturities. At some point, the Committee may want to shift its reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities to shorter-term issues, so as to gradually reduce the average maturity of our Treasury holdings toward pre-crisis levels, while leaving the aggregate value of those holdings unchanged. At this juncture, however, no decision to change reinvestment policy has been made.\\nA second way to normalize the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's securities portfolio would be to sell some holdings of agency debt and MBS. Selling agency securities, rather than simply letting them run off, would shrink the portfolio and return it to a composition of all Treasury securities more quickly. FOMC participants broadly agree that sales of agency-related securities should eventually be used as part of the strategy to normalize the portfolio. Such sales will be implemented in accordance with a framework communicated well in advance and will be conducted at a gradual pace. Because changes in the size and composition of the portfolio could affect financial conditions, however, any decisions regarding the commencement or pace of asset sales will be made in light of the Committee's evaluation of the outlook for employment and inflation.\\nAs I noted earlier, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. At some point, however, the Committee will need to begin to remove monetary policy accommodation to prevent the buildup of inflationary pressures. When that time comes, the Federal Reserve will act to increase short-term interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at Federal Reserve Banks. To tighten the linkage between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term market interest rates, the Federal Reserve may also drain reserves from the banking system. Two tools for draining reserves from the system are being developed and tested and will be ready when needed. First, the Federal Reserve is putting in place the capacity to conduct large reverse repurchase agreements with an expanded set of counterparties. Second, the Federal Reserve has tested a term deposit facility, under which instruments similar to the certificates of deposit that banks offer their customers will be auctioned to depository institutions.\\nOf course, even as the Federal Reserve continues prudent planning for the ultimate withdrawal of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation, we also recognize that the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain. We will continue to carefully assess ongoing financial and economic developments, and we remain prepared to take further policy actions as needed to foster a return to full utilization of our nation's productive potential in a context of price stability.\", \"the Congress passed landmark legislation to reform the financial system and financial regulation, and the President signed the bill into law this morning. That legislation represents significant progress toward reducing the likelihood of future financial crises and strengthening the capacity of financial regulators to respond to risks that may emerge. Importantly, the legislation encourages an approach to supervision designed to foster the stability of the financial system as a whole as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions. Within the Federal Reserve, we have already taken steps to strengthen our analysis and supervision of the financial system and systemically important financial firms in ways consistent with the new legislation. In particular, making full use of the Federal Reserve's broad expertise in economics, financial markets, payment systems, and bank supervision, we have significantly changed our supervisory framework to improve our consolidated supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, and we are enhancing the tools we use to monitor the financial sector and to identify potential systemic risks. In addition, the briefings prepared for meetings of the FOMC are now providing increased coverage and analysis of potential risks to the financial system, thus supporting the Federal Reserve's ability to make effective monetary policy and to enhance financial stability.\\nMuch work remains to be done, both to implement through regulation the extensive provisions of the new legislation and to develop the macroprudential approach called for by the Congress. However, I believe that the legislation, together with stronger regulatory standards for bank capital and liquidity now being developed, will place our financial system on a sounder foundation and minimize the risk of a repetition of the devastating events of the past three years.\"]\n"

      "[\"the U.S. economy is undergoing a severe contraction.\\xa0 Employment has fallen steeply since last autumn, and the unemployment rate has moved up to 7.6 percent.\\xa0 The deteriorating job market, considerable losses of equity and housing wealth, and tight lending conditions have weighed down consumer sentiment and spending.\\xa0 In addition, businesses have cut back capital outlays in response to the softening outlook for sales as well as the difficulty of obtaining credit.\\xa0 In contrast to the first half of last year, when robust foreign demand for U.S. goods and services provided some offset to weakness in domestic spending, exports slumped in the second half as our major trading partners fell into recession and some measures of global growth turned negative for the first time in more than 25 years.\\xa0 In all, U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) declined slightly in the third quarter of 2008, and that decline steepened considerably in the fourth quarter.\\xa0 The sharp contraction in economic activity appears to have continued into the first quarter of 2009.\\nThe substantial declines in the prices of energy and other commodities last year and the growing margin of economic slack have contributed to a substantial lessening of inflation pressures.\\xa0 Indeed, overall consumer price inflation measured on a 12-month basis was close to zero last month.\\xa0 Core inflation, which excludes the direct effects of food and energy prices, also has declined significantly.\\nThe principal cause of the economic slowdown was the collapse of the global credit boom and the ensuing financial crisis, which has affected asset values, credit conditions, and consumer and business confidence around the world.\\xa0 The immediate trigger of the crisis was the end of housing booms in the United States and other countries and the associated problems in mortgage markets, notably the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market.\\xa0 Conditions in housing and mortgage markets have proved a serious drag on the broader economy both directly, through their impact on residential construction and related industries and on household wealth, and indirectly, through the effects of rising mortgage delinquencies on the health of financial institutions.\\xa0 Recent data show that residential construction and sales continue to be very weak, house prices continue to fall, and foreclosure starts remain at very high levels.\\nThe financial crisis intensified significantly in September and October.\\xa0 In September, the Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, into conservatorship, and Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy.\\xa0 In the following weeks, several other large financial institutions failed, came to the brink of failure, or were acquired by competitors under distressed circumstances.\\xa0 Losses at a prominent money market mutual fund prompted investors, who had traditionally considered money market mutual funds to be virtually risk-free, to withdraw large amounts from such funds.\\xa0 The resulting outflows threatened the stability of short-term funding markets, particularly the commercial paper market, upon which corporations rely heavily for their short-term borrowing needs.\\xa0 Concerns about potential losses also undermined confidence in wholesale bank funding markets, leading to further increases in bank borrowing costs and a tightening of credit availability from banks.\\nRecognizing the critical importance of the provision of credit to businesses and households from financial institutions, the Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act last fall.\\xa0 Under the authority granted by this act, the Treasury purchased preferred shares in a broad range of depository institutions to shore up their capital bases.\\xa0 During this period, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) introduced its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which expanded its guarantees of bank liabilities to include selected senior unsecured obligations and all non-interest-bearing transactions deposits. \\xa0The Treasury--in concert with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC--provided packages of loans and guarantees to ensure the continued stability of Citigroup and Bank of America, two of the world's largest banks.\\xa0 Over this period, governments in many foreign countries also announced plans to stabilize their financial institutions, including through large-scale capital injections, expansions of deposit insurance, and guarantees of some forms of bank debt.\\nFaced with the significant deterioration in financial market conditions and a substantial worsening of the economic outlook, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continued to ease monetary policy aggressively in the final months of 2008, including a rate cut coordinated with five other major central banks.\\xa0 In December the FOMC brought its target for the federal funds rate to a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent, where it remains today.\\xa0 The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.\\nWith the federal funds rate near its floor, the Federal Reserve has taken additional steps to ease credit conditions.\\xa0 To support housing markets and economic activity more broadly, and to improve mortgage market functioning, the Federal Reserve has begun to purchase large amounts of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.\\xa0 Since the announcement of this program last November, the conforming fixed mortgage rate has fallen nearly 1 percentage point.\\xa0 The Federal Reserve also established new lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to enhance the flow of credit to businesses and households.\\xa0 In response to heightened stress in bank funding markets, we increased the size of the Term Auction Facility to help ensure that banks could obtain the funds they need to provide credit to their customers, and we expanded our network of swap lines with foreign central banks to ease conditions in interconnected dollar funding markets at home and abroad.\\xa0 We also established new lending facilities to support the functioning of the commercial paper market and to ease pressures on money market mutual funds.\\xa0 In an effort to restart securitization markets to support the extension of credit to consumers and small businesses, we joined with the Treasury to announce the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\\xa0 The TALF is expected to begin extending loans soon.\\nThe measures taken by the Federal Reserve, other U.S. government entities, and foreign governments since September have helped to restore a degree of stability to some financial markets.\\xa0 In particular, strains in short-term funding markets have eased notably since the fall, and London interbank offered rates (Libor)--upon which borrowing costs for many households and businesses are based--have decreased sharply.\\xa0 Conditions in the commercial paper market also have improved, even for lower-rated borrowers, and the sharp outflows from money market mutual funds seen in September have been replaced by modest inflows.\\xa0 Corporate risk spreads have declined somewhat from extraordinarily high levels, although these spreads remain elevated by historical standards.\\xa0 Likely spurred by the improvements in pricing and liquidity, issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds has been strong, and speculative-grade issuance, which was near zero in the fourth quarter, has picked up somewhat.\\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, conforming fixed mortgage rates for households have declined.\\xa0 Nevertheless, despite these favorable developments, significant stresses persist in many markets.\\xa0 Notably, most securitization markets remain shut, other than that for conforming mortgages, and some financial institutions remain under pressure.\\nIn light of ongoing concerns over the health of financial institutions, the Secretary of the Treasury recently announced a plan for further actions.\\xa0 This plan includes four principal elements:\\xa0 First, a new capital assistance program will be established to ensure that banks have adequate buffers of high-quality capital, based on the results of comprehensive stress tests to be conducted by the financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve.\\xa0 Second is a public-private investment fund in which private capital will be leveraged with public funds to purchase legacy assets from financial institutions.\\xa0 Third, the Federal Reserve, using capital provided by the Treasury, plans to expand the size and scope of the TALF to include securities backed by commercial real estate loans and potentially other types of asset-backed securities as well.\\xa0 Fourth, the plan includes a range of measures to help prevent unnecessary foreclosures.\\xa0 Together, over time these initiatives should further stabilize our financial institutions and markets, improving confidence and helping to restore the flow of credit needed to promote economic recovery.\", \"to keeping the Congress and the public informed about its lending programs and balance sheet.\\xa0 For example, we continue to add to the information shown in the Fed's H.4.1 statistical release, which provides weekly detail on the balance sheet and the amounts outstanding for each of the Federal Reserve's lending facilities.\\xa0 Extensive additional information about each of the Federal Reserve's lending programs is available online.1\\xa0 The Fed also provides bimonthly reports to the Congress on each of its programs that rely on the section 13(3) authorities.\\xa0 Generally, our disclosure policies reflect the current best practices of major central banks around the world.\\xa0 In addition, the Federal Reserve's internal controls and management practices are closely monitored by an independent inspector general, outside private-sector auditors, and internal management and operations divisions, and through periodic reviews by the Government Accountability Office.\\xa0 \\nAll that said, we recognize that recent developments have led to a substantial increase in the public's interest in the Fed's programs and balance sheet.\\xa0 For this reason, we at the Fed have begun a thorough review of our disclosure policies and the effectiveness of our communication.\\xa0 Today I would like to highlight two initiatives.\\nFirst, to improve public access to information concerning Fed policies and programs, we recently unveiled a new section of our website that brings together in a systematic and comprehensive way the full range of information that the Federal Reserve already makes available, supplemented by explanations, discussions, and analyses.2\\xa0 We will use that website as one means of keeping the public and the Congress fully informed about Fed programs.\\nSecond, at my request, Board Vice Chairman Donald Kohn is leading a committee that will review our current publications and disclosure policies relating to the Fed's balance sheet and lending policies.\\xa0 The presumption of the committee will be that the public has a right to know, and that the nondisclosure of information must be affirmatively justified by clearly articulated criteria for confidentiality, based on factors such as reasonable claims to privacy, the confidentiality of supervisory information, and the need to ensure the effectiveness of policy.\", \"projections for the January FOMC meeting, monetary policy makers substantially marked down their forecasts for real GDP this year relative to the forecasts they had prepared in October.\\xa0 The central tendency of their most recent projections for real GDP implies a decline of 1/2 percent to 1-1/4 percent over the four quarters of 2009.\\xa0 These projections reflect an expected significant contraction in the first half of this year combined with an anticipated gradual resumption of growth in the second half. \\xa0The central tendency for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was marked up to a range of 8-1/2 percent to 8-3/4 percent.\\xa0 Federal Reserve policymakers continued to expect moderate expansion next year, with a central tendency of 2-1/2 percent to 3-1/4 percent growth in real GDP and a decline in the unemployment rate by the end of 2010 to a central tendency of 8 percent to 8-1/4 percent. \\xa0FOMC participants marked down their projections for overall inflation in 2009 to a central tendency of 1/4 percent to 1 percent, reflecting expected weakness in commodity prices and the disinflationary effects of significant economic slack.\\xa0 The projections for core inflation also were marked down, to a central tendency bracketing 1 percent.\\xa0 Both overall and core inflation are expected to remain low over the next two years.\\xa0 \\nThis outlook for economic activity is subject to considerable uncertainty, and I believe that, overall, the downside risks probably outweigh those on the upside.\\xa0 One risk arises from the global nature of the slowdown, which could adversely affect U.S. exports and financial conditions to an even greater degree than currently expected. \\xa0Another risk derives from the destructive power of the so-called adverse feedback loop, in which weakening economic and financial conditions become mutually reinforcing.\\xa0 To break the adverse feedback loop, it is essential that we continue to complement fiscal stimulus with strong government action to stabilize financial institutions and financial markets.\\xa0 If actions taken by the Administration, the Congress, and the Federal Reserve are successful in restoring some measure of financial stability--and only if that is the case, in my view--there is a reasonable prospect that the current recession will end in 2009 and that 2010 will be a year of recovery.\\xa0 If financial conditions improve, the economy will be increasingly supported by fiscal and monetary stimulus, the salutary effects of the steep decline in energy prices since last summer, and the better alignment of business inventories and final sales, as well as the increased availability of credit.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nTo further increase the information conveyed by the quarterly projections, FOMC participants agreed in January to begin publishing their estimates of the values to which they expect key economic variables to converge over the longer run (say, at a horizon of five or six years), under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of new shocks to the economy.\\xa0 The central tendency for the participants' estimates of the longer-run growth rate of real GDP is 2-1/2 percent to 2-3/4 percent; the central tendency for the longer-run rate of unemployment is 4-3/4 percent to 5 percent; and the central tendency for the longer-run rate of inflation is 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent, with the majority of participants looking for 2 percent inflation in the long run.\\xa0 These values are all notably different from the central tendencies of the projections for 2010 and 2011, reflecting the view of policymakers that a full recovery of the economy from the current recession is likely to take more than two or three years. \\nThe longer-run projections for output growth and unemployment may be interpreted as the Committee's estimates of the rate of growth of output and the unemployment rate that are sustainable in the long run in the United States, taking into account important influences such as the trend growth rates of productivity and the labor force, improvements in worker education and skills, the efficiency of the labor market at matching workers and jobs, government policies affecting technological development or the labor market, and other factors.\\xa0 The longer-run projections of inflation may be interpreted, in turn, as the rate of inflation that FOMC participants see as most consistent with the dual mandate given to it by the Congress--that is, the rate of inflation that promotes maximum sustainable employment while also delivering reasonable price stability.\\xa0 This further extension of the

      "[\"taken around the world last fall may well have averted the collapse of the global financial system, an event that would have had extremely adverse and protracted consequences for the world economy. Even so, the financial shocks that hit the global economy in September and October were the worst since the 1930s, and they helped push the global economy into the deepest recession since World War II. The U.S. economy contracted sharply in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. More recently, the pace of decline appears to have slowed significantly, and final demand and production have shown tentative signs of stabilization. The labor market, however, has continued to weaken. Consumer price inflation, which fell to low levels late last year, remained subdued in the first six months of 2009.\\nTo promote economic recovery and foster price stability, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last year brought its target for the federal funds rate to a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent, where it remains today. The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant maintaining the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels for an extended period.\\nAt the time of our February report, financial markets at home and abroad were under intense strains, with equity prices at multiyear lows, risk spreads for private borrowers at very elevated levels, and some important financial markets essentially shut. Today, financial conditions remain stressed, and many households and businesses are finding credit difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, on net, the past few months have seen some notable improvements. For example, interest rate spreads in short-term money markets, such as the interbank market and the commercial paper market, have continued to narrow. The extreme risk aversion of last fall has eased somewhat, and investors are returning to private credit markets. Reflecting this greater investor receptivity, corporate bond issuance has been strong. Many markets are functioning more normally, with increased liquidity and lower bid-asked spreads. Equity prices, which hit a low point in March, have recovered to roughly their levels at the end of last year, and banks have raised significant amounts of new capital.\\nMany of the improvements in financial conditions can be traced, in part, to policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve to encourage the flow of credit. For example, the decline in interbank lending rates and spreads was facilitated by the actions of the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ensure that financial institutions have adequate access to short-term liquidity, which in turn has increased the stability of the banking system and the ability of banks to lend. Interest rates and spreads on commercial paper dropped significantly as a result of the backstop liquidity facilities that the Federal Reserve introduced last fall for that market. Our purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities and other longer-term assets have helped lower conforming fixed mortgage rates. And the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which was implemented this year, has helped restart the securitization markets for various classes of consumer and small business credit.\\nEarlier this year, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulatory agencies undertook the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), popularly known as the stress test, to determine the capital needs of the largest financial institutions. The results of the SCAP were reported in May, and they appeared to increase investor confidence in the U.S. banking system. Subsequently, the great majority of institutions that underwent the assessment have raised equity in public markets. And, on June 17, 10 of the largest U.S. bank holding companies‑‑all but one of which participated in the SCAP--repaid a total of nearly $70 billion to the Treasury.\\nBetter conditions in financial markets have been accompanied by some improvement in economic prospects. Consumer spending has been relatively stable so far this year, and the decline in housing activity appears to have moderated. Businesses have continued to cut capital spending and liquidate inventories, but the likely slowdown in the pace of inventory liquidation in coming quarters represents another factor that may support a turnaround in activity. Although the recession in the rest of the world led to a steep drop in the demand for U.S. exports, this drag on our economy also appears to be waning, as many of our trading partners are also seeing signs of stabilization.\\nDespite these positive signs, the rate of job loss remains high and the unemployment rate has continued its steep rise. Job insecurity, together with declines in home values and tight credit, is likely to limit gains in consumer spending. The possibility that the recent stabilization in household spending will prove transient is an important downside risk to the outlook.\\nIn conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared economic projections covering the years 2009 through 2011. FOMC participants generally expect that, after declining in the first half of this year, output will increase slightly over the remainder of 2009. The recovery is expected to be gradual in 2010, with some acceleration in activity in 2011. Although the unemployment rate is projected to peak at the end of this year, the projected declines in 2010 and 2011 would still leave unemployment well above FOMC participants' views of the longer-run sustainable rate. All participants expect that inflation will be somewhat lower this year than in recent years, and most expect it to remain subdued over\", 'substantial economic slack and limited inflation pressures, monetary policy remains focused on fostering economic recovery. Accordingly, as I mentioned earlier, the FOMC believes that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be appropriate for an extended period. However, we also believe that it is important to assure the public and the markets that the extraordinary policy measures we have taken in response to the financial crisis and the recession can be withdrawn in a smooth and timely manner as needed, thereby avoiding the risk that policy stimulus could lead to a future rise in inflation.1 The FOMC has been devoting considerable attention to issues relating to its exit strategy, and we are confident that we have the necessary tools to implement that strategy when appropriate.\\nTo some extent, our policy measures will unwind automatically as the economy recovers and financial strains ease, because most of our extraordinary liquidity facilities are priced at a premium over normal interest rate spreads. Indeed, total Federal Reserve credit extended to banks and other market participants has declined from roughly $1.5 trillion at the end of 2008 to less than $600 billion, reflecting the improvement in financial conditions that has already occurred. In addition, bank reserves held at the Fed will decline as the longer-term assets that we own mature or are prepaid. Nevertheless, should economic conditions warrant a tightening of monetary policy before this process of unwinding is complete, we have a number of tools that will enable us to raise market interest rates as needed.\\nPerhaps the most important such tool is the authority that the Congress granted the Federal Reserve last fall to pay interest on balances held at the Fed by depository institutions. Raising the rate of interest paid on reserve balances will give us substantial leverage over the federal funds rate and other short-term market interest rates, because banks generally will not supply funds to the market at an interest rate significantly lower than they can earn risk free by holding balances at the Federal Reserve. Indeed, many foreign central banks use the ability to pay interest on reserves to help set a floor on market interest rates. The attractiveness to banks of leaving their excess reserve balances with the Federal Reserve can be further increased by offering banks a choice of maturities for their deposits.\\nBut interest on reserves is by no means the only tool we have to influence market interest rates. For example, we can drain liquidity from the system by conducting reverse repurchase agreements, in which we sell securities from our portfolio with an agreement to buy them back at a later date. Reverse repurchase agreements, which can be executed with primary dealers, government-sponsored enterprises, and a range of other counterparties, are a traditional and well-understood method of managing the level of bank reserves. If necessary, another means of tightening policy is outright sales of our holdings of longer-term securities. Not only would such sales drain reserves and raise short-term interest rates, but they also could put upward pressure on longer-term interest rates by expanding the supply of longer-term assets. In sum, we are confident that we have the tools to raise interest rates when that becomes necessary to achieve our objectives of maximum employment', \"financial markets have faced extraordinary near-term challenges, and strong and timely actions to respond to those challenges have been necessary and appropriate. I have discussed some of the measures taken by the Federal Reserve to promote economic growth and financial stability. The Congress also has taken substantial actions, including the passage of a fiscal stimulus package. Nevertheless, even as important steps have been taken to address the recession and the intense threats to financial stability, maintaining the confidence of the public and financial markets requires that policymakers begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance. Prompt attention to questions of fiscal sustainability is particularly critical because of the coming budgetary and economic challenges associated with the retirement of the baby-boom generation and continued increases in the costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Addressing the country's fiscal problems will require difficult choices, but postponing those choices will only make them more difficult. Moreover, agreeing on a sustainable long-run fiscal path now could yield considerable near-term economic benefits in the form of lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence. Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability, we risk having neither financial stability\", 'people have a right to know how the Federal Reserve is carrying out its responsibilities and how we are using taxpayers\\' resources. The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability in its operations. We report on our activities in a variety of ways, including reports like the one I am presenting to the Congress today, other testimonies, and speeches. The FOMC releases a statement immediately after each regularly scheduled meeting and detailed minutes of each meeting on a timely basis. We have increased the frequency and scope of the published economic forecasts of FOMC participants. We provide the public with detailed annual reports on the financial activities of the Federal Reserve System that are audited by an independent public accounting firm. We also publish a complete balance sheet each week.\\n\\nWe have recently taken additional steps to better inform the public about the programs we have instituted to combat the financial crisis. We expanded our website this year to bring together already available information as well as considerable new information on our policy programs and financial activities.2 In June, we initiated a monthly report to the Congress (also posted on our website) that provides even more information on Federal Reserve liquidity programs, including breakdowns of our lending, the associated collateral, and other facets of programs established to address the financial crisis.3 These steps should help the public understand the efforts that we have taken to protect the taxpayer as we supply liquidity to the financial system and support the functioning of key credit markets.\\nThe Congress has recently discussed proposals to expand the audit authority of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) over the Federal Reserve. As you know, the Federal Reserve is already subject to frequent reviews by the GAO. The GAO has broad authority to audit our operations and functions. The Congress recently granted the GAO new authority to conduct audits of the credit facilities extended by the Federal Reserve to \"single and specific\" companies under the authority provided by section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including the loan facilities provided to, or created for, American International Group and Bear Stearns. The GAO and the Special Inspector General have the right to audit our TALF program, which uses funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program.\\nThe Congress, however, purposefully--and for good reason--excluded from the scope of potential GAO reviews some highly sensitive areas, notably monetary policy deliberations and operations, including open market and discount window operations. In doing so, the Congress carefully balanced the need for public accountability with the strong public policy benefits that flow from maintaining an appropriate degree of independence for the central bank in the making and execution of monetary policy. Financial markets, in particular, likely would see a grant of review authority in these areas to the GAO as a serious weakening of']\n"

      "[\"The economic situation has become distinctly less favorable since the time of our July report.\\xa0 Strains in financial markets, which first became evident late last summer, have persisted; and pressures on bank capital and the continued poor functioning of markets for securitized credit have led to tighter credit conditions for many households and businesses.\\xa0 The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) held up well through the third quarter despite the financial turmoil, but it has since slowed sharply.\\xa0 Labor market conditions have similarly softened, as job creation has slowed and the unemployment rate--at 4.9 percent in January--has moved up somewhat.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Many of the challenges now facing our economy stem from the continuing contraction of the U.S. housing market.\\xa0 In 2006, after a multiyear boom in residential construction and house prices, the housing market reversed course.\\xa0 Housing starts and sales of new homes are now less than half of their respective peaks, and house prices have flattened or declined in most areas.\\xa0 Changes in the availability of mortgage credit amplified the swings in the housing market.\\xa0 During the housing sector's expansion phase, increasingly lax lending standards, particularly in the subprime market, raised the effective demand for housing, pushing up prices and stimulating construction activity.\\xa0 As the housing market began to turn down, however, the slump in subprime mortgage originations, together with a more general tightening of credit conditions, has served to increase the severity of the downturn.\\xa0 Weaker house prices in turn have contributed to the deterioration in the performance of mortgage-related securities and reduced the availability of mortgage credit.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The housing market is expected to continue to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters.\\xa0 Homebuilders, still faced with abnormally high inventories of unsold homes, are likely to cut the pace of their building activity further, which will subtract from overall growth and reduce employment in residential construction and closely related industries.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid pace through much of the second half of 2007, despite the problems in the housing market, but it appears to have slowed significantly toward the end of the year.\\xa0 The jump in the price of imported energy, which eroded real incomes and wages, likely contributed to the slowdown in spending, as did the declines in household wealth associated with the weakness in house prices and equity prices.\\xa0 Slowing job creation is yet another potential drag on household spending, as gains in payroll employment averaged little more than 40,000 per month during the three months ending in January, compared with an average increase of almost 100,000 per month over the previous three months.\\xa0 However, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package should provide some support for household spending during the second half of this year and into next year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The business sector has also displayed signs of being affected by the difficulties in the housing and credit markets.\\xa0 Reflecting a downshift in the growth of final demand and tighter credit conditions for some firms, available indicators suggest that investment in equipment and software will be subdued during the first half of 2008.\\xa0 Likewise, after growing robustly through much of 2007, nonresidential construction is likely to decelerate sharply in coming quarters as business activity slows and funding becomes harder to obtain, especially for more speculative projects. \\xa0On a more encouraging note, we see few signs of any serious imbalances in business inventories aside from the overhang of unsold homes.\\xa0 And, as a whole, the nonfinancial business sector remains in good financial condition, with strong profits, liquid balance sheets, and corporate leverage near historical lows.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition, the vigor of the global economy has offset some of the weakening of domestic demand.\\xa0 U.S. real exports of goods and services increased at an annual rate of about 11 percent in the second half of last year, boosted by continuing economic growth abroad and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar. \\xa0Strengthening exports, together with moderating imports, have in turn led to some improvement in the U.S. current account deficit, which likely narrowed in 2007 (on an annual basis) for the first time since 2001.\\xa0 Although recent indicators point to some slowing of foreign economic growth, U.S. exports should continue to expand at a healthy pace in coming quarters, providing some impetus to domestic economic activity and employment.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As I have mentioned, financial markets continue to be under considerable stress.\\xa0 Heightened investor concerns about the credit quality of mortgages, especially subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates, triggered the financial turmoil.\\xa0 However, other factors, including a broader retrenchment in the willingness of investors to bear risk, difficulties in valuing complex or illiquid financial products, uncertainties about the exposures of major financial institutions to credit losses, and concerns about the weaker outlook for economic growth, have also roiled the financial markets in recent months.\\xa0 To help relieve the pressures in the market for interbank lending, the Federal Reserve--among other actions--recently introduced a term auction facility (TAF), through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit are auctioned to eligible borrowers, and we have been working with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives.\\xa0 These efforts appear to have contributed to some improvement in short-term funding markets.\\xa0 We will continue to monitor financial developments closely.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As part of its ongoing commitment to improving the accountability and public understanding of monetary policy making, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently increased the frequency and expanded the content of the economic projections made by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents and released to the public.\\xa0 The latest economic projections, which were submitted in conjunction with the FOMC meeting at the end of January and which are based on each participant's assessment of appropriate monetary policy, show that real GDP was expected to grow only sluggishly in the next few quarters and that the unemployment rate was seen as likely to increase somewhat.\\xa0 In particular, the central tendency of the projections was for real GDP to grow between 1.3 percent and 2.0 percent in 2008, down from 2-1/2 percent to 2-3/4 percent projected in our report last July.\\xa0 FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 have a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent, up from the level of about 4-3/4 percent projected last July for the same period.\\xa0 The downgrade in our projections for economic activity in 2008 since our report last July reflects the effects of the financial turmoil on real activity and a housing contraction that has been more severe than previously expected.\\xa0 By 2010, our most recent projections show output growth picking up to rates close to or a little above its longer-term trend and the unemployment rate edging lower; the improvement reflects the effects of policy stimulus and an anticipated moderation of the contraction in housing and the strains in financial and credit markets. \\xa0The incoming information since our January meeting continues to suggest sluggish economic activity in the near term.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The risks to this outlook remain to the downside.\\xa0 The risks include the possibilities that the housing market or labor market may deteriorate more than is currently anticipated and that credit conditions may tighten substantially further.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consumer price inflation has increased since our previous report, in substantial part because of the steep run-up in the price of oil.\\xa0 Last year, food prices also increased significantly, and the dollar depreciated.\\xa0 Reflecting these influences, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.4 percent over the four quarters of 2007, up from 1.9 percent in 2006.\\xa0 Core price inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices--also firmed toward the end of the year.\\xa0 The higher recent readings likely reflected some pass-through of energy costs to the prices of core consumer goods and services as well as the effect of the depreciation of the dollar on import prices.\\xa0 Moreover, core inflation in the first half of 2007 was damped by a number of transitory factors--notably, unusually soft prices for apparel and for financial services--which subsequently reversed.\\xa0 For the year as a whole, however, core PCE prices increased 2.1 percent, down slightly from 2006.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The projections recently submitted by FOMC participants indicate that overall PCE inflation was expected to moderate significantly in 2008, to between 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent (the central tendency of the projections).\\xa0 A key assumption underlying those projections was that energy and food prices would begin to flatten out, as was implied by quotes on futures markets. \\xa0In addition, diminishing pressure on resources is also consistent with the projected slowing in inflation. \\xa0The central tendency of the projections for core PCE inflation in 2008, at 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent, was a bit higher than in our July report, largely because of some higher-than-expected recent readings on prices.\\xa0 Beyond 2008, both overall and core inflation were projected to edge lower, as participants expected inflation expectations to remain reasonably well-anchored and pressures on resource utilization to be muted.\\xa0 The inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants for 2010--which ranged from 1.5 percent to 2.0\\xa0percent for overall PCE inflation--were importantly influenced by participants' judgments about the measured rates of inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and about the time frame over which policy should aim to attain those rates.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The rate of inflation that is actually realized will of course depend on a variety of factors.\\xa0 Inflation could be lower than we anticipate if slower-than-expected global growth moderates the pressure on the prices of energy and other commodities or if rates of domestic resource utilization fall more than we currently expect.\\xa0 Upside risks to the inflation projection are also present, however, including the possibilities that energy and food prices do not flatten out or that the pass-through to core prices from higher commodity prices and from the weaker dollar may be greater than we anticipate.\\xa0 Indeed, the further increases in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent weeks, together with the latest data on consumer prices, suggest slightly greater upside risks to the projections of both overall and core inflation than we saw last month.\\xa0 Should high rates of overall inflation persist, the possibility also exists that inflation expectations could become less well anchored.\\xa0 Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the FOMC to counter shortfalls in growth in the future.\\xa0 Accordingly, in the months ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor closely inflation and inflation expectations.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Let me turn now to the implications of these developments for monetary policy.\\xa0 The FOMC has responded aggressively to the weaker outlook for economic activity, having reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 225 basis points since last summer.\\xa0 As the Committee noted in its most recent post-meeting statement, the intent of those actions has been to help promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       \\xa0A critical task for the Federal Reserve over the course of this year will be to assess whether the stance of monetary policy is properly calibrated to foster our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability in an environment of downside risks to growth, stressed financial conditions, and inflation pressures.\\xa0 In particular, the FOMC will need to judge whether the policy actions taken thus far are having their intended effects.\\xa0 Monetary policy works with a lag.\\xa0 Therefore, our policy stance must be determined in light of the medium-term forecast for real activity and inflation as well as the risks to that forecast.\\xa0 Although the FOMC participants' economic projections envision an improving economic picture, it is important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain.\\xa0 The FOMC will be carefully evaluating incoming information bearing on the economic outlook and will act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Federal Reserve's recent actions to protect consumers in their financial transactions.\\xa0 In December, following up on a commitment I made at the time of our report last July, the Board issued for public comment a comprehensive set of new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, under the authority granted us by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994.\\xa0 The proposed rules would apply to all mortgage lenders and would establish lending standards to help ensure that consumers who seek mortgage credit receive loans whose terms are clearly disclosed and that can reasonably be expected to be repaid.\\xa0 Accordingly, the rules would prohibit lenders from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced mortgage loans without due regard to consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments.\\xa0 In each case, a lender making a higher-priced loan would have to use third-party documents to verify the income relied on to make the credit decision.\\xa0 For higher-priced loans, the proposed rules would require the lender to establish an escrow account for the payment of property taxes and homeowners' insurance and would prevent the use of prepayment penalties in circumstances where they might trap borrowers in unaffordable loans.\\xa0 In addition, for all mortgage loans, our proposal addresses misleading and deceptive advertising practices, requires borrowers and brokers to agree in advance on the maximum fee that the broker may receive, bans certain practices by servicers that harm borrowers, and prohibits coercion of appraisers by lenders.\\xa0 We expect substantial public comment on our proposal, and we will carefully consider all information and viewpoints while moving expeditiously to adopt final rules.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The effectiveness of the new regulations, however, will depend critically on strong enforcement.\\xa0 To that end, in conjunction with other federal and state agencies, we are conducting compliance reviews of a range of mortgage lenders, including nondepository lenders.\\xa0 The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of, and improved enforcement for, all categories of mortgage lenders.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve continues to work with financial institutions, public officials, and community groups around the country to help homeowners avoid foreclosures.\\xa0 We have called on mortgage lenders and servicers to pursue prudent loan workouts and have supported the development of streamlined, systematic approaches to expedite the loan modification process.\\xa0 We also have been providing community groups, counseling agencies, regulators, and others with detailed analyses to help identify neighborhoods at high risk from foreclosures so that local outreach efforts to help troubled borrowers can be as focused and effective as possible.\\xa0 We are actively pursuing other ways to leverage the Federal Reserve's analytical resources, regional presence, and community connections to address this critical issue.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to our consumer protection efforts in the mortgage area, we are working toward finalizing rules under the Truth in Lending Act that will require new, more informative, and consumer-tested disclosures by credit card issuers.\\xa0 Separately, we are actively reviewing potentially unfair and deceptive practices by issuers of credit cards.\\xa0 Using the Board's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, we expect to issue proposed rules regarding these practices this spring.\"]\n"

      "[\"and financial system have confronted some significant challenges thus far in 2008.\\xa0 The contraction in housing activity that began in 2006 and the associated deterioration in mortgage markets that became evident last year have led to sizable losses at financial institutions and a sharp tightening in overall credit conditions.\\xa0 The effects of the housing contraction and of the financial headwinds on spending and economic activity have been compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, which have sapped household purchasing power even as they have boosted inflation.\\xa0 Against this backdrop, economic activity has advanced at a sluggish pace during the first half of this year, while inflation has remained elevated.\\nFollowing a significant reduction in its policy rate over the second half of 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased policy considerably further through the spring to counter actual and expected weakness in economic growth and to mitigate downside risks to economic activity.\\xa0 In addition, the Federal Reserve expanded some of the special liquidity programs that were established last year and implemented additional facilities to support the functioning of financial markets and foster financial stability.\\xa0 Although these policy actions have had positive effects, the economy continues to face numerous difficulties, including ongoing strains in financial markets, declining house prices, a softening labor market, and rising prices of oil, food, and some other commodities. Let me now turn to a more detailed discussion of some of these key issues.\\nDevelopments in financial markets and their implications for the macroeconomic outlook have been a focus of monetary policy makers over the past year.\\xa0 In the second half of 2007, the deteriorating performance of subprime mortgages in the United States triggered turbulence in domestic and international financial markets as investors became markedly less willing to bear credit risks of any type.\\xa0 In the first quarter of 2008, reports of further losses and write-downs at financial institutions intensified investor concerns and resulted in further sharp reductions in market liquidity.\\xa0 By March, many dealers and other institutions, even those that had relied heavily on short-term secured financing, were facing much more stringent borrowing conditions.\\xa0 \\nIn mid-March, a major investment bank, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., was pushed to the brink of failure after suddenly losing access to short-term financing markets.\\xa0 The Federal Reserve judged that a disorderly failure of Bear Stearns would pose a serious threat to overall financial stability and would most likely have significant adverse implications for the U.S. economy.\\xa0 After discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in consultation with the Treasury, we invoked emergency authorities to provide special financing to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\xa0 In addition, the Federal Reserve used emergency authorities to establish two new facilities to provide backstop liquidity to primary dealers, with the goals of stabilizing financial conditions and increasing the availability of credit to the broader economy.1\\xa0 We have also taken additional steps to address liquidity pressures in the banking system, including a further easing of the terms for bank borrowing at the discount window and increases in the amount of credit made available to banks through the Term Auction Facility.\\xa0 The FOMC also authorized expansions of its currency swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to facilitate increased dollar lending by those institutions to banks in their jurisdictions.\\nThese steps to address liquidity pressures coupled with monetary easing seem to have been helpful in mitigating some market strains.\\xa0 During the second quarter, credit spreads generally narrowed, liquidity pressures ebbed, and a number of financial institutions raised new capital.\\xa0 However, as events in recent weeks have demonstrated, many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress, in part because the outlook for the economy, and thus for credit quality, remains uncertain.\\xa0 In recent days, investors became particularly concerned about the financial condition of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\\xa0 In view of this development, and given the importance of these firms to the mortgage market, the Treasury announced a legislative proposal to bolster their capital, access to liquidity, and regulatory oversight.\\xa0 As a supplement to the Treasury's existing authority to lend to the GSEs and as a bridge to the time when the Congress decides how to proceed on these matters, the Board of Governors authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New\\xa0York to lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should that become necessary.\\xa0 Any lending would be collateralized by U.S. government and federal agency securities.\\xa0 In general, healthy economic growth depends on well-functioning financial markets.\\xa0 Consequently, helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority of the Federal Reserve.\\nI turn now to current economic developments and prospects.\\xa0 The economy has continued to expand, but at a subdued pace.\\xa0 In the labor market, private payroll employment has declined this year, falling at an average pace of 94,000 jobs per month through June.\\xa0 Employment in the construction and manufacturing sectors has been particularly hard hit, although employment declines in a number of other sectors are evident as well.\\xa0 The unemployment rate has risen and now stands at 5-1/2 percent. \\nIn the housing sector, activity continues to weaken.\\xa0 Although sales of existing homes have been about unchanged this year, sales of new homes have continued to fall, and inventories of unsold new homes remain high.\\xa0 In response, homebuilders continue to scale back the pace of housing starts.\\xa0 Home prices are falling, particularly in regions that experienced the largest price increases earlier this decade.\\xa0 The declines in home prices have contributed to the rising tide of foreclosures; by adding to the stock of vacant homes for sale, these foreclosures have, in turn, intensified the downward pressure on home prices in some areas.\\nPersonal consumption expenditures have advanced at a modest pace so far this year, generally holding up somewhat better than might have been expected given the array of forces weighing on household finances and attitudes. \\xa0In particular, with the labor market softening and consumer price inflation elevated, real earnings have been stagnant so far this year; declining values of equities and houses have taken their toll on household balance sheets; credit conditions have tightened; and indicators of consumer sentiment have fallen sharply.\\xa0 More positively, the fiscal stimulus package is providing some timely support to household incomes.\\xa0 Overall, consumption spending seems likely to be restrained over coming quarters.\\nIn the business sector, real outlays for equipment and software were about flat in the first quarter of the year, and construction of nonresidential structures slowed appreciably.\\xa0 In the second quarter, the available data suggest that business fixed investment appears to have expanded moderately.\\xa0 Nevertheless, surveys of capital spending plans indicate that firms remain concerned about the economic and financial environment, including sharply rising costs of inputs and indications of tightening credit, and they are likely to be cautious with spending in the second half of the year.\\xa0 However, strong export growth continues to be a significant boon to many U.S. companies.\\nIn conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared economic projections covering the years 2008 through 2010.\\xa0 On balance, most FOMC participants expected that, over the remainder of this year, output would expand at a pace appreciably below its trend rate, primarily because of continued weakness in housing markets, elevated energy prices, and tight credit conditions.\\xa0 Growth is projected to pick up gradually over the next two years as residential construction bottoms out and begins a slow recovery and as credit conditions gradually improve.\\xa0 However, FOMC participants indicated that considerable uncertainty surrounded their outlook for economic growth and viewed the risks to their forecasts as skewed to the downside.\\xa0 \\nInflation has remained high, running at nearly a 3-1/2 percent annual rate over the first five months of this year as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures.\\xa0 And, with gasoline and other consumer energy prices rising in recent weeks, inflation seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term. \\nThe elevated level of overall consumer inflation largely reflects a continued sharp run-up in the prices of many commodities, especially oil but also certain crops and metals.2\\xa0 The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil soared about 60 percent in 2007 and, thus far this year, has climbed an additional 50 percent or so.\\xa0 The price of oil currently stands at about five times its level toward the beginning of this decade.\\xa0 Our best judgment is that this surge in prices has been driven predominantly by strong growth in underlying demand and tight supply conditions in global oil markets.\\xa0 Over the past several years, the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades, leading to substantial increases in the demand for oil.\\xa0 Moreover, growth has been concentrated in developing and emerging market economies, where energy consumption has been further stimulated by rapid industrialization and by government subsidies that hold down the price of energy faced by ultimate users.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nOn the supply side, despite sharp increases in prices, the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years.\\xa0 Much of the subdued supply response reflects inadequate investment and production shortfalls in politically volatile regions where large portions of the world's oil reserves are located.\\xa0 Additionally, many governments have been tightening their control over oil resources, impeding foreign investment and hindering efforts to boost capacity and production.\\xa0 Finally, sustainable rates of production in some of the more secure and accessible oil fields, such as those in the North Sea, have been declining.\\xa0 In view of these factors, estimates of long-term oil supplies have been marked down in recent months.\\xa0 Long-dated oil futures prices have risen along with spot prices, suggesting that market participants also see oil supply conditions remaining tight for years to come.\\nThe decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar has also contributed somewhat to the increase in oil prices.\\xa0 The precise size of this effect is difficult to ascertain, as the causal relationships between oil prices and the dollar are complex and run in both directions.\\xa0 However, the price of oil has risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that factors other than the dollar, notably shifts in the underlying global demand for and supply of oil, have been the principal drivers of the increase in prices. \\nAnother concern that has been raised is that financial speculation has added markedly to upward pressures on oil prices.\\xa0 Certainly, investor interest in oil and other commodities has increased substantially of late.\\xa0 However, if financial speculation were pushing oil prices above the levels consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell.\\xa0 But in fact, available data on oil inventories show notable declines over the past year.\\xa0 This is not to say that useful steps could not be taken to improve the transparency and functioning of futures markets, only that such steps are unlikely to substantially affect the prices of oil or other commodities in the longer term.\\nAlthough the inflationary effect of rising oil and agricultural commodity prices is evident in the retail prices of energy and food, the extent to which the high prices of oil and other raw materials have been passed through to the prices of non-energy, non-food finished goods and services seems thus far to have been limited. \\xa0But with businesses facing persistently higher input prices, they may attempt to pass through such costs into prices of final goods and services more aggressively than they have so far. \\xa0Moreover, as the foreign exchange value of the dollar has declined, rises in import prices have put greater upward pressure on business costs and consumer prices.\\xa0 In their economic projections for the June FOMC meeting, monetary policy makers marked up their forecasts for inflation during 2008 as a whole.\\xa0 FOMC participants continue to expect inflation to moderate in 2009 and 2010, as slower global growth leads to a cooling of commodity markets, as pressures on resource utilization decline, and as longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.\\xa0 However, in light of the persistent escalation of commodity prices in recent quarters, FOMC participants viewed the inflation outlook as unusually uncertain and cited the possibility that commodity prices will continue to rise as an important risk to the inflation forecast. \\xa0Moreover, the currently high level of inflation, if sustained, might lead the public to revise up its expectations for longer-term inflation.\\xa0 If that were to occur, and those revised expectations were to become embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process, we could see an unwelcome rise in actual inflation over the longer term.\\xa0 A critical responsibility of monetary policy makers is to prevent that process from taking hold.\\nAt present, accurately assessing and appropriately balancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation is a significant challenge for monetary policy makers.\\xa0 The possibility of higher energy prices, tighter credit conditions, and a still-deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth.\\xa0 At the same time, upside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified lately, as the rising prices of energy and some other commodities have led to a sharp pickup in inflation and some measures of inflation expectations have moved higher.\\xa0 Given the high degree of uncertainty, monetary policy makers will need to carefully assess incoming information bearing on the outlook for both inflation and growth.\\xa0 In light of the increase in upside inflation risk, we must be particularly alert to any indications, such as an erosion of longer-term inflation expectations, that the inflationary impulses from commodity prices are becoming embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process.\\nI would like to conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on some of the Federal Reserve's actions in the area of consumer protection.\\xa0 At the time of our report last February, I described the Board's proposal to adopt comprehensive new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, using our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994.\\xa0 After reviewing the more-than 4,500 comment letters we received on the proposed rules, the Board approved the final rules yesterday.\\xa0 \\nThe new rules apply to all types of mortgage lenders and will establish lending standards aimed at curbing abuses while preserving responsible subprime lending and sustainable homeownership.\\xa0 The final rules prohibit lenders from making higher-priced loans without due regard for consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments and require lenders to verify the income and assets on which they rely when making the credit decision.\\xa0 Also, for higher-priced loans, lenders now will be required to establish escrow accounts so that property taxes and insurance costs will be included in consumers' regular monthly payments.\\xa0 The final rules also prohibit prepayment penalties for higher-priced loans in cases in which the consumer's payment can increase during the first few years and restrict prepayment penalties on other higher-priced loans\\xa0 Other measures address the coercion of appraisers, servicer practices, and other issues.\\xa0 We believe the new rules will help to restore confidence in the mortgage market.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nIn May, working jointly with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration, the Board issued proposed rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act to address unfair or deceptive practices for credit card accounts and overdraft protection plans.\\xa0 Credit cards provide a convenient source of credit for many consumers, but the terms of credit card loans have become more complex, which has reduced transparency.\\xa0 Our consumer testing has persuaded us that disclosures alone cannot solve this problem.\\xa0 Thus, the Board's proposed rules would require card issuers to alter their practices in ways that will allow consumers to better understand how their own decisions and actions will affect their costs.\\xa0 Card issuers would be prohibited from increasing interest rates retroactively to cover prior purchases except under very limited circumstances.\\xa0 For accounts having multiple interest rates, when consumers seek to pay down their balance by paying more than the minimum, card issuers would be prohibited from maximizing interest charges by applying excess payments to the lowest rate balance first.\\xa0 The proposed rules dealing with bank overdraft services seek to give consumers greater control by ensuring that they have ample opportunity to opt out of automatic payments of overdrafts. \\xa0The Board has already received more than 20,000 comment letters in response to the proposed rules.\"]\n"

      "[\"in the United States expanded at a solid pace in 2006, although the pattern of growth was uneven. After a first-quarter rebound from weakness associated with the effects of the hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf Coast the previous summer, output growth moderated somewhat on average over the remainder of 2006. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of about 2-3/4 percent in the second half of the year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       As we anticipated in our July report, the U.S. economy appears to be making a transition from the rapid rate of expansion experienced over the preceding several years to a more sustainable average pace of growth. The principal source of the ongoing moderation has been a substantial cooling in the housing market, which has led to a marked slowdown in the pace of residential construction. However, the weakness in housing market activity and the slower appreciation of house prices do not seem to have spilled over to any significant extent to other sectors of the economy. Consumer spending has continued to expand at a solid rate, and the demand for labor has remained strong. On average, about 165,000 jobs per month have been added to nonfarm payrolls over the past six months, and the unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent in January, remains low.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Inflation pressures appear to have abated somewhat following a run-up during the first half of 2006. Overall inflation has fallen, in large part as a result of declines in the price of crude oil. Readings on core inflation--that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy--have improved modestly in recent months. Nevertheless, the core inflation rate remains somewhat elevated.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the five policy meetings since the July report, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. So far, the incoming data have supported the view that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable economic growth and a gradual ebbing of core inflation. However, in the statement accompanying last month's policy decision, the FOMC again indicated that its predominant policy concern is the risk that inflation will fail to ease as expected and that it is prepared to take action to address inflation risks if developments warrant.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Let me now discuss the economic outlook in a little more detail, beginning with developments in the real economy and then turning to inflation. I will conclude with some brief comments on monetary policy.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Consumer spending continues to be the mainstay of the current economic expansion. Personal consumption expenditures, which account for more than two-thirds of aggregate demand, increased at an annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent in real terms during the second half of last year, broadly matching the brisk pace of the previous three years. Consumer outlays were supported by strong gains in personal income, reflecting both the ongoing increases in payroll employment and a pickup in the growth of real wages. Real hourly compensation--as measured by compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector deflated by the personal consumption expenditures price index--rose at an annual rate of around 3 percent in the latter half of 2006.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The resilience of consumer spending is all the more striking given the backdrop of the substantial correction in the housing market that became increasingly evident during the spring and summer of last year. By the middle of 2006, monthly sales of new and existing homes were about 15 percent lower than a year earlier, and the previously rapid rate of house-price appreciation had slowed markedly. The fall in housing demand in turn prompted a sharp slowing in the pace of construction of new homes. Even so, the backlog of unsold homes rose from about four-and-a-half months' supply in 2005 to nearly seven months' supply by the third quarter of last year. Single-family housing starts have dropped more than 30 percent since the beginning of last year, and employment growth in the construction sector has slowed substantially.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Some tentative signs of stabilization have recently appeared in the housing market: New and existing home sales have flattened out in recent months, mortgage applications have picked up, and some surveys find that homebuyers' sentiment has improved. However, even if housing demand falls no further, weakness in residential investment is likely to continue to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters as homebuilders seek to reduce their inventories of unsold homes to more-comfortable levels.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Despite the ongoing adjustments in the housing sector, overall economic prospects for households remain good. Household finances appear generally solid, and delinquency rates on most types of consumer loans and residential mortgages remain low. The exception is subprime mortgages with variable interest rates, for which delinquency rates have increased appreciably. The labor market is expected to stay healthy, and real incomes should continue to rise, although the pace of employment gains may be slower than that to which we have become accustomed in recent years. In part, slower average job growth may simply reflect the moderation of economic activity. Also, the impending retirement of the leading edge of the baby-boom generation, and an apparent leveling out of women's participation rate in the workforce, which had risen for several decades, will likely restrain the growth of the labor force in coming years. With fewer jobseekers entering the labor force, the rate of job creation associated with the maintenance of stable conditions in the labor market will decline. All told, consumer expenditures appear likely to expand solidly in coming quarters, albeit a little less rapidly than the growth in personal incomes if, as we expect, households respond to the slow pace of home-equity appreciation by saving more out of current income.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The business sector remains in excellent financial condition, with strong growth in profits, liquid balance sheets, and corporate leverage near historical lows. Last year, those factors helped to support continued advances in business capital expenditures. Notably, investment in high-tech equipment rose 9 percent in 2006, and spending on nonresidential structures (such as office buildings, factories, and retail space) increased rapidly through much of the year after several years of weakness. Growth in business spending slowed toward the end of last year, reflecting mainly a deceleration of spending on business structures; a drop in outlays in the transportation sector, where spending is notably volatile; and some weakness in purchases of equipment related to construction and motor vehicle manufacturing. Over the coming year, capital spending is poised to expand at a moderate pace, supported by steady gains in business output and favorable financial conditions. Inventory levels in some sectors--most notably at motor vehicle dealers and in some construction-related manufacturing industries--rose over the course of last year, leading some firms to cut production to better align inventories with sales. Remaining imbalances may continue to impose modest restraint on industrial production during the early part of this year.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Outside the United States, economic activity in our major trading partners has continued to grow briskly. The strength of demand abroad helped spur a robust expansion in U.S. real exports, which grew about 9 percent last year. The pattern of real U.S imports was somewhat uneven, partly because of fluctuations in oil imports over the course of the year. On balance, import growth slowed in 2006, to 3 percent. Economic growth abroad should support further steady growth in U.S. exports this year. Despite the improvements in trade performance, the U.S. current account deficit remains large, averaging about 6-1/2 percent of nominal GDP during the first three quarters of 2006 (the latest available data).\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Overall, the U.S. economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace this year and next, with growth strengthening somewhat as the drag from housing diminishes. Such an outlook is reflected in the projections that the members of the Board of Governors and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks made around the time of the FOMC meeting late last month. The central tendency of those forecasts--which are based on the information available at that time and on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy--is for real GDP to increase about 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 2007 and about 2-3/4 to 3 percent in 2008. The projection for GDP growth in 2007 is slightly lower than our projection last July. This difference partly reflects an expectation of somewhat greater weakness in residential construction during the first part of this year than we anticipated last summer. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2007 and 2008 around 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The risks to this outlook are significant. To the downside, the ultimate extent of the housing market correction is difficult to forecast and may prove greater than we anticipate. Similarly, spillover effects from developments in the housing market onto consumer spending and employment in housing-related industries may be more pronounced than expected. To the upside, output may expand more quickly than expected if consumer spending continues to increase at the brisk pace seen in the second half of 2006.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       I turn now to the inflation situation. As I noted earlier, there are some indications that inflation pressures are beginning to diminish. The monthly data are noisy, however, and it will consequently be some time before we can be confident that underlying inflation is moderating as anticipated. Recent declines in overall inflation have primarily reflected lower prices for crude oil, which have fed through to the prices of gasoline, heating oil, and other energy products used by consumers. After moving higher in the first half of 2006, core consumer price inflation has also edged lower recently, reflecting a relatively broad-based deceleration in the prices of core goods. That deceleration is probably also due to some extent to lower energy prices, which have reduced costs of production and thereby lessened one source of pressure on the prices of final goods and services. The ebbing of core inflation has likely been promoted as well by the stability of inflation expectations.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       A waning of the temporary factors that boosted inflation in recent years will probably help foster a continued edging down of core inflation. In particular, futures quotes imply that oil prices are expected to remain well below last year's peak. If actual prices follow the path currently indicated by futures prices, inflation pressures would be reduced further as the benefits of the decline in oil prices from last year's high levels are passed through to a broader range of core goods and services. Nonfuel import prices may also put less pressure on core inflation, particularly if price increases for some other commodities, such as metals, slow from last year's rapid rates. But as we have been reminded only too well in recent years, the prices of oil and other commodities are notoriously difficult to predict, and they remain a key source of uncertainty to the inflation outlook. The contribution from rents and shelter costs should also fall back, following a step-up last year. The faster pace of rent increases last year may have been attributable in part to the reduced affordability of owner-occupied housing, which led to a greater demand for rental housing. Rents should rise somewhat less quickly this year and next, reflecting recovering demand for owner-occupied housing as well as increases in the supply of rental units, but the extent and pace of that adjustment is not yet clear.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Upward pressure on inflation could materialize if final demand were to exceed the underlying productive capacity of the economy for a sustained period. The rate of resource utilization is high, as can be seen in rates of capacity utilization above their long-term average and, most evidently, in the tightness of the labor market. Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that businesses are having difficulty recruiting well-qualified workers in certain occupations. Measures of labor compensation, though still growing at a moderate pace, have shown some signs of acceleration over the past year, likely in part the result of tight labor market conditions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The implications for inflation of faster growth in nominal labor compensation depend on several factors. Increases in compensation might be offset by higher labor productivity or absorbed by a narrowing of firms' profit margins rather than passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices; in these circumstances, gains in nominal compensation would translate into gains in real compensation as well. Underlying productivity trends appear favorable, and the markup of prices over unit labor costs is high by historical standards, so such an outcome is certainly possible. Moreover, if activity expands over the next year or so at the moderate pace anticipated by the FOMC, pressures in both labor and product markets should ease modestly. That said, the possibility remains that tightness in product markets could allow firms to pass higher labor costs through to prices, adding to inflation and effectively nullifying the purchasing power of at least some portion of the increase in labor compensation. Thus, the high level of resource utilization remains an important upside risk to continued progress on inflation.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Another significant factor influencing medium-term trends in inflation is the public's expectations of inflation. These expectations have an important bearing on whether transitory influences on prices, such as those created by changes in energy costs, become embedded in wage and price decisions and so leave a lasting imprint on the rate of inflation. It is encouraging that inflation expectations appear to have remained contained.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The projections of the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks are for inflation to continue to ebb over this year and next. In particular, the central tendency of those forecasts is for core inflation--as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy--to be 2 to 2-1/4 percent this year and to edge lower, to 1-3/4 to 2 percent, next year. But as I noted earlier, the FOMC has continued to view the risk that inflation will not moderate as expected as the predominant policy concern.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Monetary policy affects spending and inflation with long and variable lags. Consequently, policy decisions must be based on an assessment of medium-term economic prospects. At the same time, because economic forecasting is an uncertain enterprise, policymakers must be prepared to respond flexibly to developments in the economy when those developments lead to a re-assessment of the outlook. The dependence of monetary policy actions on a broad range of incoming information complicates the public's attempts to understand and anticipate policy decisions.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Clear communication by the central bank about the economic outlook, the risks to that outlook, and its monetary policy strategy can help the public to understand the rationale behind policy decisions and to anticipate better the central bank's reaction to new information. This understanding should, in turn, enhance the effectiveness of policy and lead to improved economic outcomes. By reducing uncertainty, central bank transparency may also help anchor the public's longer-term expectations of inflation. Much experience has shown that well-anchored inflation expectations tend to help stabilize inflation and promote maximum sustainable economic growth. Good communication by the central bank is also vital for ensuring appropriate accountability for its policy actions, the full effects of which can be observed only after a lengthy period. A transparent policy process improves accountability by clarifying how a central bank expects to attain its policy objectives and by ensuring that policy is conducted in a manner that can be seen to be consistent with achieving those objectives.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Over the past decade or so, the Federal Reserve has significantly improved its methods of communication, but further progress is possible. As you know, the FOMC last year established a subcommittee to help the full Committee evaluate the next steps in this continuing process. Our discussions are directed at examining all aspects of our communications and have been deliberate and thorough. These discussions are continuing, and no decisions have been reached. My colleagues and I remain firmly committed to an open and transparent monetary policy process that enhances our ability to achieve our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. I will keep members of this Committee apprised of developments as our deliberations move forward. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the members of this Committee and your colleagues in the Senate and House on the important issues pertaining to monetary policy and the other responsibilities with which the Congress has charged the Federal Reserve.\"]\n"

      "[\"this occasion marks the thirtieth year of semiannual testimony on the economy and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.\\xa0 In establishing these hearings, the Congress proved prescient in anticipating the worldwide trend toward greater transparency and accountability of central banks in the making of monetary policy.\\xa0 Over the years, these testimonies and the associated reports have proved an invaluable vehicle for the Federal Reserve's communication with the public about monetary policy, even as they have served to enhance the Federal Reserve's accountability for achieving the dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability set for it by the Congress.\\xa0 I take this opportunity to reiterate the Federal Reserve's strong support of the dual mandate; in pursuing maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy makes its greatest possible contribution to the general economic welfare.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Let me now review the current economic situation and the outlook, beginning with developments in the real economy and the situation regarding inflation before turning to monetary policy.\\xa0 I will conclude with comments on issues related to lending to households and consumer protection--topics not normally addressed in monetary policy testimony but, in light of recent developments, deserving of our attention today.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       After having run at an above-trend rate earlier in the current economic recovery, U.S. economic growth has proceeded during the past year at a pace more consistent with sustainable expansion.\\xa0 Despite the downshift in growth, the demand for labor has remained solid, with more than 850,000 jobs having been added to payrolls thus far in 2007 and the unemployment rate having remained at 4-1/2 percent. The combination of moderate gains in output and solid advances in employment implies that recent increases in labor productivity have been modest by the standards of the past decade.\\xa0 The cooling of productivity growth in recent quarters is likely the result of cyclical or other temporary factors, but the underlying pace of productivity gains may also have slowed somewhat.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       To a considerable degree, the slower pace of economic growth in recent quarters reflects the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector.\\xa0 Over the past year, home sales and construction have slowed substantially and house prices have decelerated.\\xa0 Although a leveling-off of home sales in the second half of 2006 suggested some tentative stabilization of housing demand, sales have softened further this year, leading the number of unsold new homes in builders' inventories to rise further relative to the pace of new home sales.\\xa0 Accordingly, construction of new homes has sunk further, with starts of new single-family houses thus far this year running 10 percent below the pace in the second half of last year.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The pace of home sales seems likely to remain sluggish for a time, partly as a result of some tightening in lending standards and the recent increase in mortgage interest rates.\\xa0 Sales should ultimately be supported by growth in income and employment as well as by mortgage rates that--despite the recent increase--remain fairly low relative to historical norms.\\xa0 However, even if demand stabilizes as we expect, the pace of construction will probably fall somewhat further as builders work down stocks of unsold new homes.\\xa0 Thus, declines in residential construction will likely continue to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters, although the magnitude of the drag on growth should diminish over time.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       Real consumption expenditures appear to have slowed last quarter, following two quarters of rapid expansion.\\xa0 Consumption outlays are likely to continue growing at a moderate pace, aided by a strong labor market.\\xa0 Employment should continue to expand, though possibly at a somewhat slower pace than in recent years as a result of the recent moderation in the growth of output and ongoing demographic shifts that are expected to lead to a gradual decline in labor force participation.\\xa0 Real compensation appears to have risen over the past year, and barring further sharp increases in consumer energy costs, it should rise further as labor demand remains strong and productivity increases.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In the business sector, investment in equipment and software showed a modest gain in the first quarter.\\xa0 A similar outcome is likely for the second quarter, as weakness in the volatile transportation equipment category appears to have been offset by solid gains in other categories.\\xa0 Investment in nonresidential structures, after slowing sharply late last year, seems to have grown fairly vigorously in the first half of 2007.\\xa0 Like consumption spending, business fixed investment overall seems poised to rise at a moderate pace, bolstered by gains in sales and generally favorable financial conditions.\\xa0 Late last year and early this year, motor vehicle manufacturers and firms in several other industries found themselves with elevated inventories, which led them to reduce production to better align inventories with sales.\\xa0 Excess inventories now appear to have been substantially eliminated and should not prove a further restraint on growth.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       The global economy continues to be strong.\\xa0 Supported by solid economic growth abroad, U.S. exports should expand further in coming quarters.\\xa0 Nonetheless, our trade deficit--which was about 5-1/4 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter--is likely to remain high.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       For the most part, financial markets have remained supportive of economic growth.\\xa0 However, conditions in the subprime mortgage sector have deteriorated significantly, reflecting mounting delinquency rates on adjustable-rate loans.\\xa0 In recent weeks, we have also seen increased concerns among investors about credit risk on some other types of financial instruments.\\xa0 Credit spreads on lower-quality corporate debt have widened somewhat, and terms for some leveraged business loans have tightened.\\xa0 Even after their recent rise, however, credit spreads remain near the low end of their historical ranges, and financing activity in the bond and business loan markets has remained fairly brisk.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       Overall, the U.S. economy appears likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007, with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend.\\xa0 Such an assessment was made around the time of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in deliberations on monetary policy. \\xa0The central tendency of the growth forecasts, which are conditioned on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, is for real GDP to expand roughly 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent this year and 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent in 2008.\\xa0 The forecasted performance for this year is about 1/4 percentage point below that projected in February, the difference being largely the result of weaker-than-expected residential construction activity this year.\\xa0 The unemployment rate is anticipated to edge up to between 4-1/2 and 4-3/4 percent over the balance of this year and about 4-3/4 percent in 2008, a trajectory about the same as the one expected in February.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       I turn now to the inflation situation.\\xa0 Sizable increases in food and energy prices have boosted overall inflation and eroded real incomes in recent months--both unwelcome developments.\\xa0 As measured by changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), inflation ran at an annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first five months of this year, a rate that, if maintained, would clearly be inconsistent with the objective of price stability.  1\\xa0 Because monetary policy works with a lag, however, policymakers must focus on the economic outlook.\\xa0 Food and energy prices tend to be quite volatile, so that, looking forward, core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) may be a better gauge than overall inflation of underlying inflation trends.\\xa0 Core inflation has moderated slightly over the past few months, with core PCE inflation coming in at an annual rate of about 2 percent so far this year.\\n\\r\\n       Although the most recent readings on core inflation have been favorable, month-to-month movements in inflation are subject to considerable noise, and some of the recent improvement could also be the result of transitory influences. \\xa0However, with long-term inflation expectations contained, futures prices suggesting that investors expect energy and other commodity prices to flatten out, and pressures in both labor and product markets likely to ease modestly, core inflation should edge a bit lower, on net, over the remainder of this year and next year.\\xa0 The central tendency of FOMC participants' forecasts for core PCE inflation--2 to 2-1/4 percent for 2007 and 1-3/4 to 2 percent in 2008--is unchanged from February.\\xa0 If energy prices level off as currently anticipated, overall inflation should slow to a pace close to that of core inflation in coming quarters.\\n\\r\\n       At each of its four meetings so far this year, the FOMC maintained its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent, judging that the existing stance of policy was likely to be consistent with growth running near trend and inflation staying on a moderating path.\\xa0 As always, in determining the appropriate stance of policy, we will be alert to the possibility that the economy is not evolving in the way we currently judge to be the most likely.\\xa0 One risk to the outlook is that the ongoing housing correction might prove larger than anticipated, with possible spillovers onto consumer spending.\\xa0 Alternatively, consumer spending, which has advanced relatively vigorously, on balance, in recent quarters, might expand more quickly than expected; in that case, economic growth could rebound to a pace above its trend.\\xa0 With the level of resource utilization already elevated, the resulting pressures in labor and product markets could lead to increased inflation over time.\\xa0 Yet another risk is that energy and commodity prices could continue to rise sharply, leading to further increases in headline inflation and, if those costs passed through to the prices of non-energy goods and services, to higher core inflation as well.\\xa0 Moreover, if inflation were to move higher for an extended period and that increase became embedded in longer-term inflation expectations, the re-establishment of price stability would become more difficult and costly to achieve.\\xa0 With the level of resource utilization relatively high and with a sustained moderation in inflation pressures yet to be convincingly demonstrated, the FOMC has consistently stated that upside risks to inflation are its predominant policy concern.\\xa0\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       In addition to its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve has an important responsibility to help protect consumers in financial services transactions.\\xa0 For nearly forty years, the Federal Reserve has been active in implementing, interpreting, and enforcing consumer protection laws.\\xa0 I would like to discuss with you this morning some of our recent initiatives and actions, particularly those related to subprime mortgage lending.\\n\\r\\n       Promoting access to credit and to homeownership are important objectives, and responsible subprime mortgage lending can help advance both goals.\\xa0 In designing regulations, policymakers should seek to preserve those benefits.\\xa0 That said, the recent rapid expansion of the subprime market was clearly accompanied by deterioration in underwriting standards and, in some cases, by abusive lending practices and outright fraud.\\xa0 In addition, some households took on mortgage obligations they could not meet, perhaps in some cases because they did not fully understand the terms.\\xa0 Financial losses have subsequently induced lenders to tighten their underwriting standards.\\xa0 Nevertheless, rising delinquencies and foreclosures are creating personal, economic, and social distress for many homeowners and communities--problems that likely will get worse before they get better.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       The Federal Reserve is responding to these difficulties at both the national and the local levels.\\xa0 In coordination with the other federal supervisory agencies, we are encouraging the financial industry to work with borrowers to arrange prudent loan modifications to avoid unnecessary foreclosures.\\xa0 Federal Reserve Banks around the country are cooperating with community and industry groups that work directly with borrowers having trouble meeting their mortgage obligations.\\xa0 We continue to work with organizations that provide counseling about mortgage products to current and potential homeowners.\\xa0 We are also meeting with market participants--including lenders, investors, servicers, and community groups--to discuss their concerns and to gain information about market developments.\\n\\r\\n       We are conducting a top-to-bottom review of possible actions we might take to help prevent recurrence of these problems.\\xa0 First, we are committed to providing more-effective disclosures to help consumers defend against improper lending.\\xa0 Three years ago, the Board began a comprehensive review of Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).\\xa0 The initial focus of our review was on disclosures related to credit cards and other revolving credit accounts.\\xa0 After conducting extensive consumer testing, we issued a proposal in May that would require credit card issuers to provide clearer and easier-to-understand disclosures to customers.\\xa0 In particular, the new disclosures would highlight applicable rates and fees, particularly penalties that might be imposed.\\xa0 The proposed rules would also require card issuers to provide forty-five days' advance notice of a rate increase or any other change in account terms so that consumers will not be surprised by unexpected charges and will have time to explore alternatives.\\n\\r\\n       We are now engaged in a similar review of the TILA rules for mortgage loans.\\xa0 We began this review last year by holding four public hearings across the country, during which we gathered information on the adequacy of disclosures for mortgages, particularly for nontraditional and adjustable-rate products.\\xa0 As we did with credit card lending, we will conduct extensive consumer testing of proposed disclosures.\\xa0 Because the process of designing and testing disclosures involves many trial runs, especially given today's diverse and sometimes complex credit products, it may take some time to complete our review and propose new disclosures.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       However, some other actions can be implemented more quickly.\\xa0 By the end of the year, we will propose changes to TILA rules to address concerns about mortgage loan advertisements and solicitations that may be incomplete or misleading and to require lenders to provide mortgage disclosures more quickly so that consumers can get the information they need when it is most useful to them.\\xa0 We already have improved a disclosure that creditors must provide to every applicant for an adjustable-rate mortgage product to explain better the features and risks of these products, such as “payment shock” and rising loan balances.\\r\\n    \\n\\r\\n       We are certainly aware, however, that disclosure alone may not be sufficient to protect consumers.\\xa0 Accordingly, we plan to exercise our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) to address specific practices that are unfair or deceptive.\\xa0 We held a public hearing on June 14 to discuss industry practices, including those pertaining to pre-payment penalties, the use of escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated-income and low-documentation lending, and the evaluation of a borrower's ability to repay.\\xa0 The discussion and ideas we heard were extremely useful, and we look forward to receiving additional public comments in coming weeks.\\xa0 Based on the information we are gathering, I expect that the Board will propose additional rules under HOEPA later this year.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       In coordination with the other federal supervisory agencies, last year we issued principles-based guidance on nontraditional mortgages, and in June of this year we issued supervisory guidance on subprime lending.\\xa0 These statements emphasize the fundamental consumer protection principles of sound underwriting and effective disclosures.\\xa0 In addition, we reviewed our policies related to the examination of nonbank subsidiaries of bank and financial holding companies for compliance with consumer protection laws and guidance.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       As a result of that review and following discussions with the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and state regulators, as represented by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, we are launching a cooperative pilot project aimed at expanding consumer protection compliance reviews at selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime mortgage operations.\\xa0 The reviews will begin in the fourth quarter of this year and will include independent state-licensed mortgage lenders, nondepository mortgage lending subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with or serving as agents of these entities.\\xa0 The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of and improved enforcement for nondepository mortgage lenders.\\xa0 Working together to address jurisdictional issues and to improve information-sharing among agencies, we will seek to prevent abusive and fraudulent lending while ensuring that consumers retain access to beneficial credit.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n       I believe that the actions I have described today will help address the current problems.\\xa0 The Federal Reserve looks forward to working with the Congress\"]\n"

      "[\"The U.S. economy performed impressively in 2005. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased a bit more than 3 percent, building on the sustained expansion that gained traction in the middle of 2003. Payroll employment rose 2 million in 2005, and the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent. Productivity continued to advance briskly. \\nThe economy achieved these gains despite some significant obstacles. Energy prices rose substantially yet again, in response to increasing global demand, hurricane-related disruptions to production, and concerns about the adequacy and reliability of supply. The Gulf Coast region suffered through severe hurricanes that inflicted a terrible loss of life; destroyed homes, personal property, businesses, and infrastructure on a massive scale; and displaced more than a million people. The storms also damaged facilities and disrupted production in many industries, with substantial effects on the energy and petrochemical sectors and on the region's ports. Full recovery in the affected areas is likely to be slow. The hurricanes left an imprint on aggregate economic activity as well, seen, in part, in the marked deceleration of real GDP in the fourth quarter. However, the most recent evidence--including indicators of production, the flow of new orders to businesses, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance, and the payroll employment and retail sales figures for January--suggests that the economic expansion remains on track. \\nInflation pressures increased in 2005. Steeply rising energy prices pushed up overall inflation, raised business costs, and squeezed household budgets. Nevertheless, the increase in prices for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, at just below 2 percent, remained moderate, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to have been contained. \\nWith the economy expanding at a solid pace, resource utilization rising, cost pressures increasing, and short-term interest rates still relatively low, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) over the course of 2005 continued the process of removing monetary policy accommodation, raising the federal funds rate 2 percentage points in eight increments of 25 basis points each. At its meeting on January 31 of this year, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate another 1/4 percentage point, bringing its level to 4-1/2 percent. \\nAt that meeting¸ monetary policymakers also discussed the economic outlook for the next two years. The central tendency of the forecasts of members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks is for real GDP to increase about 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent in 2007. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 at a level between 4-3/4 percent and 5 percent. Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, is predicted to be about 2 percent this year and 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent next year. While considerable uncertainty surrounds any economic forecast extending nearly two years, I am comfortable with these projections. \\nIn the announcement following the January 31 meeting, the Federal Reserve pointed to risks that could add to inflation pressures. Among those risks is the possibility that, to an extent greater than we now anticipate, higher energy prices may pass through into the prices of non-energy goods and services or have a persistent effect on inflation expectations. Another factor bearing on the inflation outlook is that the economy now appears to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization. Gauging the economy's sustainable potential is difficult, and the Federal Reserve will keep a close eye on all the relevant evidence and be flexible in making those judgments. Nevertheless, the risk exists that, with aggregate demand exhibiting considerable momentum, output could overshoot its sustainable path, leading ultimately--in the absence of countervailing monetary policy action--to further upward pressure on inflation. In these circumstances, the FOMC judged that some further firming of monetary policy may be necessary, an assessment with which I concur. \\nNot all of the risks to the economy concern inflation. For example, a number of indicators point to a slowing in the housing market. Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth of overall economic activity. However, given the substantial gains in house prices and the high levels of home construction activity over the past several years, prices and construction could decelerate more rapidly than currently seems likely. Slower growth in home equity, in turn, might lead households to boost their saving and trim their spending relative to current income by more than is now anticipated. The possibility of significant further increases in energy prices represents an additional risk to the economy; besides affecting inflation, such increases might also hurt consumer confidence and thereby reduce spending on non-energy goods and services. \\nAlthough the outlook contains significant uncertainties, it is clear that substantial progress has been made in removing monetary policy accommodation. As a consequence, in coming quarters the FOMC will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy actions will be increasingly dependent on incoming data. \\nIn assessing the prospects for the economy, some appreciation of recent circumstances is essential, so let me now review key developments of 2005 and discuss their implications for the outlook. The household sector was a mainstay of the economic expansion again last year, and household spending is likely to remain an important source of growth in aggregate demand in 2006. The growth in household spending last year was supported by rising employment and moderate increases in wages. Expenditures were buoyed as well by significant gains in household wealth that reflected further increases in home values and in broad equity prices. However, sharply rising bills for gasoline and heating reduced the amount of income available for spending on other consumer goods and services. \\nResidential investment also expanded considerably in 2005, supported by a strong real estate market. However, as I have already noted, some signs of slowing in the housing market have appeared in recent months: Home sales have softened, the inventory of unsold homes has risen, and indicators of homebuilder and homebuyer sentiment have turned down. Anecdotal information suggests that homes typically are on the market somewhat longer than they were a year or so ago, and the frequency of contract offers above asking prices reportedly has diminished. Financial market conditions seem to be consistent with some moderation in housing activity. Interest rates on thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which were around 5-3/4 percent over much of 2005, rose noticeably in the final months of the year to their current level of around 6-1/4 percent. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages have climbed more considerably. Still, despite the recent increases, mortgage rates remain relatively low. Low mortgage rates, together with expanding payrolls and incomes and the need to rebuild after the hurricanes, should continue to support the housing market. Thus, at this point, a leveling out or a modest softening of housing activity seems more likely than a sharp contraction, although significant uncertainty attends the outlook for home prices and construction. In any case, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor this sector closely. \\nOverall, the financial health of households appears reasonably good. Largely reflecting the growth in home mortgages, total household debt continued to expand rapidly in 2005. But the value of household assets also continued to climb strongly, driven by gains in home prices and equity shares. To some extent, sizable increases in household wealth, as well as low interest rates, have contributed in recent years to the low level of personal saving. Saving last year was probably further depressed by the rise in households' energy bills. Over the next few years, saving relative to income is likely to rise somewhat from its recent low level. \\nIn the business sector, profits continued to rise last year at a solid pace, boosted in part by continuing advances in productivity. Strong corporate balance sheets combined with expanding sales and favorable conditions in financial markets fostered a solid increase in spending on equipment and software last year. Investment in high-tech equipment rebounded, its increase spurred by further declines in the prices of high-tech goods. Expenditures for communications equipment, which had fallen off earlier this decade, showed particular strength for the year as a whole. In contrast, nonresidential construction activity remained soft. \\nAlthough the financial condition of the business sector is generally quite strong, several areas of structural weakness are evident, notably in the automobile and airline industries. Despite these problems, however, favorable conditions in the business sector as a whole should encourage continued expansion of capital investment. \\nFor the most part, the financial situation of state and local governments has improved noticeably over the past couple of years. Rising personal and business incomes have buoyed tax revenues, affording some scope for increases in state and local government expenditures. At the federal level, the budget deficit narrowed appreciably in fiscal 2005. Outlays rose rapidly, but receipts climbed even more sharply as the economy expanded. However, defense expenditures, hurricane relief, and increasing entitlement costs seem likely to worsen the deficit in fiscal 2006. \\nOutside the United States, economic activity strengthened last year, and at present global growth seems to be on a good track. The economies of our North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico, appear to be expanding at a solid pace. Especially significant have been signs that Japan could be emerging from its protracted slump and its battle with deflation. In the euro area, expansion has been somewhat modest by global standards, but recent indicators suggest that growth could be strengthening there as well. Economies in emerging Asia generally continue to expand strongly. In particular, growth in China remained vigorous in 2005. \\nExpanding foreign economic activity helped drive a vigorous advance in U.S. exports in 2005, while the growth of real imports slowed. Nonetheless, the nominal U.S. trade deficit increased further last year, exacerbated in part by a jump in the value of imported petroleum products that almost wholly reflected the sharply rising price of crude oil. \\nSurging energy prices also were the dominant factor influencing U.S. inflation last year. For the second year in a row, overall consumer prices, as measured by the chain-type index for personal consumption expenditures, rose about 3 percent. Prices of consumer energy products jumped more than 20 percent, with large increases in prices of natural gas, gasoline, and fuel oil. Food prices, however, rose only modestly. And core consumer prices (that is, excluding food and energy) increased a moderate 1.9 percent. \\nThe relatively benign performance of core inflation despite the steep increases in energy prices can be attributed to several factors. Over the past few decades, the U.S. economy has become significantly less energy intensive. Also, rapid advances in productivity as well as increases in nominal wages and salaries that, on balance, have been moderate have restrained unit labor costs in recent years. \\nAnother key factor in keeping core inflation low has been confidence on the part of the public and investors in the prospects for price stability. Maintaining expectations of low and stable inflation is an essential element in the Federal Reserve's effort to promote price stability. And, thus far, the news has been good: Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have responded only a little to the larger fluctuations in energy prices that we have experienced, and for the most part, they were low and stable last year. Inflation compensation for the period five to ten years ahead, derived from spreads between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities, has remained well anchored. \\nRestrained inflation expectations have also been an important reason that long-term interest rates have remained relatively low. At roughly 4-1/2 percent at year-end, yields on ten-year nominal Treasury issues increased only slightly on balance over 2005 even as short-term rates rose 2 percentage points. As previous reports and testimonies from the Federal Reserve indicated, a decomposition of long-term nominal yields into spot and forward rates suggests that it is primarily the far-forward components that account for the low level of long rates. The premiums that investors demand as compensation for the risk of unforeseen changes in real interest rates and inflation appear to have declined significantly over the past decade or so. Given the more stable macroeconomic climate in the United States and in the global economy since the mid-1980s, some decline in risk premiums is not surprising. In addition, though, investors seem to expect real interest rates to remain relatively low. Such a view is consistent with a hypothesis I offered last year--that, in recent years, an excess of desired global saving over the quantity of global investment opportunities that pay historically normal returns has forced down the real interest rate prevailing in global capital markets. \\nInflation prospects are important, not just because price stability is in itself desirable and part of the Federal Reserve's mandate from the Congress, but also because price stability is essential for strong and stable growth of output and employment. Stable prices promote long-term economic growth by allowing households and firms to make economic decisions and undertake productive activities with fewer concerns about large or unanticipated changes in the price level and their attendant financial consequences. Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability in output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy. Similarly, the attainment of the statutory goal of moderate long-term interest rates requires price stability, because only then are the inflation premiums that investors demand for holding long-term instruments kept to a minimum. In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; it is also central to attaining the Federal Reserve's other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long-term interest rates. \\nAs always, however, translating the Federal Reserve's general economic objectives into operational decisions about the stance of monetary policy poses many challenges. Over the past few decades, policymakers have learned that no single economic or financial indicator, or even a small set of such indicators, can provide reliable guidance for the setting of monetary policy. \\nRather, the Federal Reserve, together with all modern central banks, has found that the successful conduct of monetary policy requires painstaking examination of a broad range of economic and financial data, careful consideration of the implications of those data for the likely path of the economy and inflation, and prudent judgment regarding the effects of alternative courses of policy action on prospects for achieving our macroeconomic objectives. In that process, economic models can provide valuable guidance to policymakers, and over the years substantial progress has been made in developing formal models and forecasting techniques. But any model is by necessity a simplification of the real world, and sufficient data are seldom available to measure even the basic relationships with precision. Monetary policymakers must therefore strike a difficult balance--conducting rigorous analysis informed by sound economic theory and empirical methods while keeping an open mind about the many factors, including myriad global influences, at play in a dynamic modern economy like that of the United States. Amid significant uncertainty, we must formulate a view of the most likely course of the economy under a given policy approach while giving due weight to the potential risks and associated costs to the economy should those judgments turn out to be wrong. \\nDuring the nearly three years that I previously spent as a member of the Board of Governors and of the Federal Open Market Committee, the approach to policy that I have just outlined was standard operating procedure under the highly successful leadership of Chairman Greenspan. As I indicated to the Congress during my confirmation hearing, my intention is to maintain continuity with this and the other practices of the Federal Reserve in the Greenspan era. I believe that, with this approach, the Federal Reserve will continue to contribute to the sound performance of the U.S. economy\"]\n"

      "['since our February report, the U.S. economy has continued to expand. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter of 2006. The available indicators suggest that economic growth has more recently moderated from that quite strong pace, reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and other factors that I will discuss. With respect to the labor market, more than 850,000 jobs were added, on net, to nonfarm payrolls over the first six months of the year, though these gains came at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first. Last month the unemployment rate stood at 4.6 percent.\\nInflation has been higher than we had anticipated in February, partly as a result of further sharp increases in the prices of energy and other commodities. During the first five months of the year, overall inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures averaged 4.3 percent at an annual rate. Over the same period, core inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices--averaged 2.6 percent at an annual rate. To address the risk that inflation pressures might remain elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continued to firm the stance of monetary policy, raising the federal funds rate another 3/4 percentage point, to 5-1/4 percent, in the period since our last report.\\nLet me now review the current economic situation and the outlook in a bit more detail, beginning with developments in the real economy and then turning to the inflation situation. I will conclude with some comments on monetary policy.\\nThe U.S. economy appears to be in a period of transition. For the past three years or so, economic growth in the United States has been robust. This growth has reflected both the ongoing re-employment of underutilized resources, as the economy recovered from the weakness of earlier in the decade, and the expansion of the economy\\'s underlying productive potential, as determined by such factors as productivity trends and growth of the labor force. Although the rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain cannot be known with any precision, it is clear that, after several years of above-trend growth, slack in resource utilization has been substantially reduced. As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve a modest reduction in the growth of economic activity from the rapid pace of the past three years to a pace more consistent with the rate of increase in the nation\\'s underlying productive capacity. It bears emphasizing that, because productivity growth seems likely to remain strong, the productive capacity of our economy should expand over the next few years at a rate sufficient to support solid growth in real output.\\nAs I have noted, the anticipated moderation in economic growth now seems to be under way, although the recent erratic growth pattern complicates this assessment. That moderation appears most evident in the household sector. In particular, consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of aggregate spending, grew rapidly during the first quarter but decelerated during the spring. One likely source of this deceleration was higher energy prices, which have adversely affected the purchasing power of households and weighed on consumer attitudes.\\nOutlays for residential construction, which have been at very high levels in recent years, rose further in the first quarter. More recently, however, the market for residential real estate has been cooling, as can be seen in the slowing of new and existing home sales and housing starts. Some of the recent softening in housing starts may have resulted from the unusually favorable weather during the first quarter of the year, which pulled forward construction activity, but the slowing of the housing market appears to be more broad-based than can be explained by that factor alone. Home prices, which have climbed at double-digit rates in recent years, still appear to be rising for the nation as a whole, though significantly less rapidly than before. These developments in the housing market are not particularly surprising, as the sustained run-up in housing prices, together with some increase in mortgage rates, has reduced affordability and thus the demand for new homes.\\nThe slowing of the housing market may restrain other forms of household spending as well. With homeowners no longer experiencing increases in the equity value of their homes at the rapid pace seen in the past few years, and with the recent declines in stock prices, increases in household net worth are likely to provide less of a boost to consumer expenditures than they have in the recent past. That said, favorable fundamentals, including relatively low unemployment and rising disposable incomes, should provide support for consumer spending. Overall, household expenditures appear likely to expand at a moderate pace, providing continued impetus to the overall economic expansion. \\nAlthough growth in household spending has slowed, other sectors of the economy retain considerable momentum. Business investment in new capital goods appears to have risen briskly, on net, so far this year. In particular, investment in nonresidential structures, which had been weak since 2001, seems to have picked up appreciably, providing some offset to the slower growth in residential construction. Spending on equipment and software has also been strong. With a few exceptions, business inventories appear to be well aligned with sales, which reduces the risk that a buildup of unwanted inventories might act to reduce production in the future. Business investment seems likely to continue to grow at a solid pace, supported by growth in final sales, rising backlogs of orders for capital goods, and high rates of profitability. To be sure, businesses in certain sectors have experienced financial difficulties. In the aggregate, however, firms remain in excellent financial condition, and credit conditions for businesses are favorable.\\nGlobally, output growth appears strong. Growth of the global economy will help support U.S. economic activity by continuing to stimulate demand for our exports of goods and services. One downside of the strength of the global economy, however, is that it has led to significant increases in the demand for crude oil and other primary commodities over the past few years. Together with heightened geopolitical uncertainties and the limited ability of suppliers to expand capacity in the short run, these rising demands have resulted in sharp rises in the prices at which those goods are traded internationally, which in turn has put upward pressure on costs and prices in the United States.\\nOverall, the U.S. economy seems poised to grow in coming quarters at a pace roughly in line with the expansion of its underlying productive capacity. Such an outlook is embodied in the projections of members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks that were made around the time of the FOMC meeting late last month, based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. In particular, the central tendency of those forecasts is for real GDP to increase about 3-1/4 percent to 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3-1/4 percent in 2007. With output expanding at a pace near that of the economy\\'s potential, the civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 between 4-3/4 percent and 5 percent, close to its recent level.\\nI turn now to the inflation situation. As I noted, inflation has been higher than we expected at the time of our last report. Much of the upward pressure on overall inflation this year has been due to increases in the prices of energy and other commodities and, in particular, to the higher prices of products derived from crude oil. Gasoline prices have increased notably as a result of the rise in petroleum prices as well as factors specific to the market for ethanol. The pickup in inflation so far this year has also been reflected in the prices of a range of non-energy goods and services, as strengthening demand may have given firms more ability to pass energy and other costs through to consumers. In addition, increases in residential rents, as well as in the imputed rent on owner-occupied homes, have recently contributed to higher core inflation.\\nThe recent rise in inflation is of concern to the FOMC. The achievement of price stability is one of the objectives that make up the Congress\\'s mandate to the Federal Reserve. Moreover, in the long run, price stability is critical to achieving maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, the other parts of the congressional mandate.\\nThe outlook for inflation is shaped by a number of factors, not the least of which is the course of energy prices. The spot price of oil has moved up significantly further in recent weeks. Futures quotes imply that market participants expect petroleum prices to roughly stabilize in coming quarters; such an outcome would, over time, reduce one source of upward pressure on inflation. However, expectations of a leveling out of oil prices have been consistently disappointed in recent years, and as the experience of the past week suggests, possible increases in these and other commodity prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook.\\nAlthough the costs of energy and other raw materials are important, labor costs are by far the largest component of business costs. Anecdotal reports suggest that the labor market is tight in some industries and occupations and that employers are having difficulty attracting certain types of skilled workers. To date, however, moderate growth in most broad measures of nominal labor compensation and the ongoing increases in labor productivity have held down the rise in unit labor costs, reducing pressure on inflation from the cost side. Employee compensation per hour is likely to rise more quickly over the next couple of years in response to the strength of the labor market. Whether faster increases in nominal compensation create additional cost pressures for firms depends in part on the extent to which they are offset by continuing productivity gains. Profit margins are currently relatively wide, and the effect of a possible acceleration in compensation on price inflation would thus also depend on the extent to which competitive pressures force firms to reduce margins rather than pass on higher costs.\\nThe public\\'s inflation expectations are another important determinant of inflation. The Federal Reserve must guard against the emergence of an inflationary psychology that could impart greater persistence to what would otherwise be a transitory increase in inflation. After rising earlier this year, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, based on surveys and on a comparison of yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt, have edged down and remain contained. These developments bear watching, however.\\nFinally, the extent to which aggregate demand is aligned with the economy\\'s underlying productive potential also influences inflation. As I noted earlier, FOMC participants project that the growth in economic activity should moderate to a pace close to that of the growth of potential both this year and next. Should that moderation occur as anticipated, it should help to limit inflation pressures over time.\\nThe projections of the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, which are based on information available at the time of the last FOMC meeting, are for a gradual decline in inflation in coming quarters. As measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, inflation is projected to be 2-1/4 percent to 2-1/2 percent this year and then to edge lower, to 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent next year.\\nThe FOMC projections, which now anticipate slightly lower growth in real output and higher core inflation than expected in our February report, mirror the somewhat more adverse circumstances facing our economy, which have resulted from the recent steep run-up in energy costs and higher-than-expected inflation more generally. But they also reflect our assessment that, with appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of significant unforeseen developments, the economy should continue to expand at a solid and sustainable pace and core inflation should decline from its recent level over the medium term.\\nAlthough our baseline forecast is for moderating inflation, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. In particular, the high prices of energy and other commodities, in conjunction with high levels of resource utilization that may increase the pricing power of suppliers of goods and services, have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. More generally, if the pattern of elevated readings on inflation is more protracted or more intense than is currently expected, this higher level of inflation could become embedded in the public\\'s inflation expectations and in price-setting behavior. Persistently higher inflation would erode the performance of the real economy and would be costly to reverse. The Federal Reserve must take account of these risks in making its policy decisions.\\nIn our pursuit of maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy makers operate in an environment of uncertainty. In particular, we have imperfect knowledge about the effects of our own policy actions as well as of the many other factors that will shape economic developments during the forecast period. These uncertainties bear importantly on our policy decisions because the full influence of policy actions on the economy is felt only after a considerable period of time. The lags between policy actions and their effects imply that we must be forward-looking, basing our policy choices on the longer-term outlook for both inflation and economic growth. In formulating that outlook, we must take account of the possible future effects of previous policy actions--that is, of policy effects still \"in the pipeline.\" Finally, as I have noted, we must consider not only what appears to be the most likely outcome but also the risks to that outlook and the costs that would be incurred should any of those risks be realized. \\nAt the same time, because economic forecasting is far from a precise science, we have no choice but to regard all our forecasts as provisional and subject to revision as the facts demand. Thus, policy must be flexible and ready to adjust to changes in economic projections. In particular, as the Committee noted in the statement issued after its June meeting, the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address inflation risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by our analysis of the incoming information.']\n"

      "['when I presented our last report to the Congress, the economy, supported by\\r\\nstrong underlying fundamentals, appeared to be on a solid growth path, and\\r\\nthose circumstances prevailed through March. Accordingly, the Federal Open\\r\\nMarket Committee (FOMC) continued the process of a measured removal of monetary\\r\\naccommodation, which it had begun in June 2004, by raising the federal funds\\r\\nrate 1/4 percentage point at both the February and the March meetings.\\r\\n\\nThe\\r\\nupbeat picture became cloudier this spring, when data on economic activity\\r\\nproved to be weaker than most market participants had anticipated and inflation\\r\\nmoved up in response to the jump in world oil prices. By the time of the May\\r\\nFOMC meeting, some evidence suggested that the economy might have been entering\\r\\na soft patch reminiscent of the middle of last year, perhaps as a result of\\r\\nhigher energy costs worldwide. In particular, employment gains had slowed from\\r\\nthe strong pace of the end of 2004, consumer sentiment had weakened, and the\\r\\nmomentum in household and business spending appeared to have dissipated\\r\\nsomewhat.\\nAt the May\\r\\nmeeting, the Committee had to weigh the extent to which this weakness was\\r\\nlikely to be temporary--perhaps simply the product of the normal ebb and flow\\r\\nof a business expansion--and the extent to which it reflected some influence\\r\\nthat might prove more persistent, such as the further run-up in crude oil\\r\\nprices. While the incoming data highlighted some downside risks to the outlook\\r\\nfor economic growth, the FOMC judged the balance of information as suggesting\\r\\nthat the economy had not weakened fundamentally.\\nMoreover, core\\r\\ninflation had moved higher again through the first quarter. The rising prices\\r\\nof energy and other commodities continued to place upward pressures on costs,\\r\\nand reports of greater pricing power of firms indicated that they might be more\\r\\nable to pass those higher costs on to their customers. Given these\\r\\nconsiderations, the Committee continued the process of gradually removing\\r\\nmonetary accommodation in May.\\nThe data released\\r\\nover the past two months or so accord with the view that the earlier soft\\r\\nreadings on the economy were not presaging a more serious slowdown in the pace\\r\\nof activity. Employment has remained on an upward trend, retail spending has\\r\\nposted appreciable gains, inventory levels are modest, and business investment\\r\\nappears to have firmed. At the same time, low long-term interest rates have\\r\\ncontinued to provide a lift to housing activity. Although both overall and\\r\\ncore consumer price inflation have eased of late, the prices of oil and natural\\r\\ngas have moved up again on balance since May and are likely to place some upward\\r\\npressure on consumer prices, at least over the near term. Slack in labor and\\r\\nproduct markets has continued to decline. In light of these developments, the\\r\\nFOMC raised the federal funds rate at its June meeting to further reduce\\r\\nmonetary policy accommodation. That action brought the cumulative increase in\\r\\nthe funds rate over the past year to 2-1/4 percentage points.\\nShould the prices\\r\\nof crude oil and natural gas flatten out after their recent run-up--the\\r\\nforecast currently embedded in futures markets--the prospects for aggregate\\r\\ndemand appear favorable. Household spending--buoyed by past gains in wealth,\\r\\nongoing increases in employment and income, and relatively low interest\\r\\nrates--is likely to continue to expand. Business investment in equipment and\\r\\nsoftware seems to be on a solid upward trajectory in response to supportive\\r\\nconditions in financial markets and the ongoing need to replace or upgrade\\r\\naging high-tech and other equipment. Moreover, some recovery in nonresidential\\r\\nconstruction appears in the offing, spurred partly by lower vacancy rates and\\r\\nrising prices for commercial properties. However, given the comparatively less\\r\\nbuoyant growth of many foreign economies and the recent increase in the foreign\\r\\nexchange value of the dollar, our external sector does not yet seem poised to contribute\\r\\nsteadily to U.S. growth.\\nA flattening out\\r\\nof the prices of crude oil and natural gas, were it to materialize, would also\\r\\nlessen upward pressures on inflation. Overall inflation would probably drop\\r\\nback noticeably from the rates experienced in 2004 and early 2005, and core\\r\\ninflation could hold steady or edge lower. Prices of crude materials and\\r\\nintermediate goods have softened of late, and the slower rise in import prices\\r\\nthat should result from the recent strength in the foreign exchange value of\\r\\nthe dollar could also relieve some pressure on inflation.\\nThus, our baseline\\r\\noutlook for the U.S. economy is one of sustained economic growth and contained\\r\\ninflation pressures. In our view, realizing this outcome will require the\\r\\nFederal Reserve to continue to remove monetary accommodation. This generally\\r\\nfavorable outlook, however, is attended by some significant uncertainties that\\r\\nwarrant careful scrutiny.\\nWith regard to the\\r\\noutlook for inflation, future price performance will be influenced importantly\\r\\nby the trend in unit labor costs, or its equivalent, the ratio of hourly labor\\r\\ncompensation to output per hour. Over most of the past several years, the\\r\\nbehavior of unit labor costs has been quite subdued. But those costs have\\r\\nturned up of late, and whether the favorable trends of the past few years will\\r\\nbe maintained is unclear. Hourly labor compensation as measured from the\\r\\nnational income and product accounts increased sharply near the end of 2004. However,\\r\\nthat measure appears to have been boosted significantly by temporary factors.\\r\\nOther broad measures suggest that hourly labor compensation continues to rise\\r\\nat a moderate rate.\\nThe evolution of\\r\\nunit labor costs will also reflect the growth of output per hour. Over the\\r\\npast decade, the U.S. economy has benefited from a remarkable acceleration of\\r\\nproductivity: Strong gains in efficiency have buoyed real incomes and\\r\\nrestrained inflation. But experience suggests that such rapid advances are\\r\\nunlikely to be maintained in an economy that has reached the cutting edge of\\r\\ntechnology. Over the past two years, growth in output per hour seems to have\\r\\nmoved off the peak that it reached in 2003. However, the cause, extent, and\\r\\nduration of that slowdown are not yet clear. The traditional measure of the growth\\r\\nin output per hour, which is based on output as measured from the product side\\r\\nof the national accounts, has slowed sharply in recent quarters. But a\\r\\nconceptually equivalent measure that uses output measured from the income side\\r\\nhas slowed far less. Given the divergence between these two readings, a\\r\\nreasonably accurate determination of the extent of the recent slowing in\\r\\nproductivity growth and its parsing into cyclical and secular influences will\\r\\nrequire the accumulation of more evidence.\\nEnergy prices\\r\\nrepresent a second major uncertainty in the economic outlook. A further rise\\r\\ncould cut materially into private spending and thus damp the rate of economic\\r\\nexpansion. In recent weeks, spot prices for crude oil and natural gas have\\r\\nbeen both high and volatile. Prices for far-future delivery of oil and gas\\r\\nhave risen even more markedly than spot prices over the past year. Apparently,\\r\\nmarket participants now see little prospect of appreciable relief from elevated\\r\\nenergy prices for years to come. Global demand for energy apparently is\\r\\nexpected to remain strong, and market participants are evidencing increased\\r\\nconcerns about the potential for supply disruptions in various oil-producing\\r\\nregions.\\nTo be sure, the\\r\\ncapacity to tap and utilize the world\\'s supply of oil continues to expand.\\r\\nMajor advances in recovery rates from existing reservoirs have enhanced proved\\r\\nreserves despite ever fewer discoveries of major oil fields. But, going\\r\\nforward, because of the geographic location of proved reserves, the great\\r\\nmajority of the investment required to convert reserves into new crude oil\\r\\nproductive capacity will need to be made in countries where foreign investment\\r\\nis currently prohibited or restricted or faces considerable political risk.\\r\\nMoreover, the preponderance of oil and gas revenues of the dominant national\\r\\noil companies is perceived as necessary to meet the domestic needs of growing\\r\\npopulations. These factors have the potential to constrain the ability of\\r\\nproducers to expand capacity to keep up with the projected growth of world\\r\\ndemand, which has been propelled to an unexpected extent by burgeoning demand\\r\\nin emerging Asia. \\nMore\\r\\nfavorably, the current and prospective expansion of U.S. capability to import\\r\\nliquefied natural gas will help ease longer-term natural gas stringencies and\\r\\nperhaps bring natural gas prices in the United States down to world levels. \\nThe third major\\r\\nuncertainty in the economic outlook relates to the behavior of long-term\\r\\ninterest rates. The yield on ten-year Treasury notes, currently near 4-1/4\\r\\npercent, is about\\r\\n50 basis points below its level of late spring 2004. Moreover, even after the\\r\\nrecent widening of credit risk spreads, yields for both investment-grade and\\r\\nless-than-investment-grade corporate bonds have declined even more than those\\r\\non Treasury notes over the same period.\\nThis decline in\\r\\nlong-term rates has occurred against the backdrop of generally firm U.S.\\r\\neconomic growth, a continued boost to inflation from higher energy prices, and\\r\\nfiscal pressures associated with the fast approaching retirement of the\\r\\nbaby-boom generation.1\\r\\nThe drop in long-term rates is especially surprising given the increase in the\\r\\nfederal funds rate over the same period. Such a pattern is clearly without\\r\\nprecedent in our recent experience. \\nThe\\r\\nunusual behavior of long-term interest rates first became apparent last year.\\r\\nIn May and June of 2004, with a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal\\r\\nReserve widely expected, market participants built large short positions in\\r\\nlong-term debt instruments in anticipation of the increase in bond yields that\\r\\nhas been historically associated with an initial rise in the federal funds\\r\\nrate. Accordingly, yields on ten-year Treasury notes rose during the spring of\\r\\nlast year about 1 percentage point. But by summer, pressures emerged in the\\r\\nmarketplace that drove long-term rates back down. In March of this year,\\r\\nlong-term rates once again began to rise, but like last year, market forces\\r\\ncame into play to make those increases short lived.\\nConsiderable\\r\\ndebate remains among analysts as to the nature of those market forces.\\r\\nWhatever those forces are, they are surely global, because the decline in\\r\\nlong-term interest rates in the past year is even more pronounced in major\\r\\nforeign financial markets than in the\\r\\n  United States.\\nTwo distinct but\\r\\noverlapping developments appear to be at work: a longer-term trend decline in\\r\\nbond yields and an acceleration of that trend of late. Both developments are\\r\\nparticularly evident in the interest rate applying to the one-year period\\r\\nending ten years from today that can be inferred from the U.S. Treasury yield\\r\\ncurve. In 1994, that so-called forward rate exceeded 8 percent. By mid-2004,\\r\\nit had declined to about 6-1/2 percent--an easing of about 15 basis points per\\r\\nyear on average.2\\r\\nOver the past year, that drop steepened, and the forward rate fell 130 basis\\r\\npoints to less than 5 percent.\\nSome, but not all,\\r\\nof the decade-long trend decline in that forward yield can be ascribed to\\r\\nexpectations of lower inflation, a reduced risk premium resulting from less\\r\\ninflation volatility, and a smaller real term premium that seems due to a\\r\\nmoderation of the business cycle over the past few decades.3\\r\\nThis decline in inflation expectations and risk premiums is a signal\\r\\ndevelopment. As I noted in my testimony before this Committee in February, the\\r\\neffective productive capacity of the global economy has substantially\\r\\nincreased, in part because of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the\\r\\nintegration of China and India into the global marketplace. And this increase\\r\\nin capacity, in turn, has doubtless contributed to expectations of lower\\r\\ninflation and lower inflation-risk premiums.\\nIn addition to\\r\\nthese factors, the trend reduction worldwide in long-term yields surely reflects\\r\\nan excess of intended saving over intended investment. This configuration is\\r\\nequivalent to an excess of the supply of funds relative to the demand for\\r\\ninvestment. What is unclear is whether the excess is due to a glut of saving\\r\\nor a shortfall of investment. Because intended capital investment is to some\\r\\nextent driven by forces independent of those governing intended saving, the gap\\r\\nbetween intended saving and investment can be quite wide and variable. It is\\r\\nreal interest rates that bring actual capital investment worldwide and its\\r\\nmeans of financing, global saving, into equality. We can directly observe only\\r\\nthe actual flows, not the saving and investment tendencies. Nonetheless, as\\r\\nbest we can judge, both high levels of intended saving and low levels of\\r\\nintended investment have combined to lower real long-term interest rates over\\r\\nthe past decade. \\nSince the\\r\\nmid-1990s, a significant increase in the share of world gross domestic product\\r\\n(GDP) produced by economies with persistently above-average saving--prominently\\r\\nthe emerging economies of Asia--has put upward pressure on world saving. These\\r\\npressures have been supplemented by shifts in income toward the oil-exporting\\r\\ncountries, which more recently have built surpluses because of steep increases\\r\\nin oil prices. The changes in shares of world GDP, however, have had little\\r\\neffect on actual world capital investment as a percentage of GDP. The fact\\r\\nthat investment as a percentage of GDP apparently changed little when real\\r\\ninterest rates were falling, even adjusting for the shift in the shares of\\r\\nworld GDP, suggests that, on average, countries\\' investment propensities had\\r\\nbeen declining.4\\nSoftness in\\r\\nintended investment is also evident in corporate behavior. Although corporate\\r\\ncapital investment in the major industrial countries rose in recent years, it\\r\\napparently failed to match increases in corporate cash flow.5\\r\\nIn the United States, for example, capital expenditures were below the very\\r\\nsubstantial level of corporate cash flow in 2003, the first shortfall since the\\r\\nsevere recession of 1975. That development was likely a result of the business\\r\\ncaution that was apparent in the wake of the stock market decline and the\\r\\ncorporate scandals early this decade. (Capital investment in the United States\\r\\nhas only recently shown signs of shedding at least some of that caution.)\\r\\nJapanese investment exhibited prolonged restraint following the bursting of\\r\\ntheir speculative bubble in the early 1990s. And investment in emerging Asia\\r\\nexcluding China fell appreciably after the Asian financial crisis in the late\\r\\n1990s. Moreover, only a modest part of the large revenue surpluses of\\r\\noil-producing nations has been reinvested in physical assets. In fact, capital\\r\\ninvestment in the Middle East in 2004, at 25 percent of the region\\'s GDP, was\\r\\nthe same as in 1998. National saving, however, rose from 21 percent to 32\\r\\npercent of GDP. The unused saving of this region was invested in world\\r\\nmarkets.\\nWhether the excess\\r\\nof global intended saving over intended investment has been caused by weak\\r\\ninvestment or excessive saving--that is, by weak consumption--or, more likely,\\r\\na combination of both does not much affect the intermediate-term outlook for\\r\\nworld GDP or, for that matter, U.S. monetary policy. What have mattered in\\r\\nrecent years are the sign and the size of the gap of intentions and the\\r\\nimplications for interest rates, not whether the gap results from a saving glut\\r\\nor an investment shortfall. That said, saving and investment propensities do\\r\\nmatter over the longer run. Higher levels of investment relative to\\r\\nconsumption build up the capital stock and thus add to the productive potential\\r\\nof an economy.\\nThe economic\\r\\nforces driving the global saving-investment balance have been unfolding over\\r\\nthe course of the past decade, so the steepness of the recent decline in\\r\\nlong-term dollar yields and the associated distant forward rates suggests that\\r\\nsomething more may have been at work over the past year.6\\r\\nInflation premiums in forward rates ten years ahead have apparently continued\\r\\nto decline, but real yields have also fallen markedly over the past year. It\\r\\nis possible that the factors that have tended to depress real yields over the\\r\\npast decade have accelerated recently, though that notion seems implausible.\\nAccording to estimates\\r\\nprepared by the Federal Reserve Board staff, a significant portion of the sharp\\r\\ndecline in the ten-year forward one-year rate over the past year appears to\\r\\nhave resulted from a fall in term premiums. Such estimates are subject to\\r\\nconsiderable uncertainty. Nevertheless, they suggest that risk takers have\\r\\nbeen encouraged by a perceived increase in economic stability to reach out to\\r\\nmore distant time horizons. These actions have been accompanied by significant\\r\\ndeclines in measures of expected volatility in equity and credit markets\\r\\ninferred from prices of stock and bond options and narrow credit risk\\r\\npremiums. History cautions that long periods of relative stability often\\r\\nengender unrealistic expectations of its permanence and, at times, may lead to financial\\r\\nexcess and economic stress.\\n Such perceptions, many\\r\\nobservers believe, are contributing to the boom in home prices and creating\\r\\nsome associated risks. And, certainly, the exceptionally low interest rates on\\r\\nten-year Treasury notes, and hence on home mortgages, have been a major factor\\r\\nin the recent surge of homebuilding, home turnover, and particularly in the\\r\\nsteep climb in home prices. Whether home prices on average for the nation as a\\r\\nwhole are overvalued relative to underlying determinants is difficult to ascertain,\\r\\nbut there do appear to be, at a minimum, signs of froth in some local markets\\r\\nwhere home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels. Among other\\r\\nindicators, the significant rise in purchases of homes for investment since\\r\\n2001 seems to have charged some regional markets with speculative fervor. \\nThe apparent froth\\r\\nin housing markets appears to have interacted with evolving practices in\\r\\nmortgage markets. The increase in the prevalence of interest-only loans and\\r\\nthe introduction of more-exotic forms of adjustable-rate mortgages are\\r\\ndevelopments of particular concern. To be sure, these financing vehicles have\\r\\ntheir appropriate uses. But some households may be employing these instruments\\r\\nto purchase homes that would otherwise be unaffordable, and consequently their\\r\\nuse could be adding to pressures in the housing market. Moreover, these\\r\\ncontracts may leave some mortgagors vulnerable to adverse events. It is\\r\\nimportant that lenders fully appreciate the risk that some households may have\\r\\ntrouble meeting monthly payments as interest rates and the macroeconomic\\r\\nclimate change.\\nThe U.S. economy\\r\\nhas weathered such episodes before without experiencing significant declines in\\r\\nthe national average level of home prices. Nevertheless, we certainly cannot\\r\\nrule out declines in home prices, especially in some local markets. If\\r\\ndeclines were to occur, they likely would be accompanied by some economic\\r\\nstress, though the macroeconomic implications need not be substantial.\\r\\nNationwide banking and widespread securitization of mortgages make financial\\r\\nintermediation less likely to be impaired than it was in some previous episodes\\r\\nof regional house-price correction. Moreover, a decline in the national\\r\\nhousing price level would need to be substantial to trigger a significant rise\\r\\nin foreclosures, because the vast majority of homeowners have built up\\r\\nsubstantial equity in their homes despite large mortgage-market-financed\\r\\nwithdrawals of home equity in recent years. \\nHistorically, it\\r\\nhas been rising real long-term interest rates that have restrained the pace of\\r\\nresidential building and have suppressed existing home sales, high levels of\\r\\nwhich have been the major contributor to the home equity extraction that\\r\\narguably has financed a noticeable share of personal consumption expenditures\\r\\nand home modernization outlays.\\nThe trend of\\r\\nmortgage rates, or long-term interest rates more generally, is likely to be\\r\\ninfluenced importantly by the worldwide evolution of intended saving and\\r\\nintended investment. We at the Federal Reserve will be closely monitoring the\\r\\npath of this global development few, if any, have previously experienced. As I\\r\\nindicated earlier, the capital investment climate in the United States appears\\r\\nto be improving following significant headwinds since late 2000, as is that in Japan.\\r\\nCapital investment in Europe, however, remains tepid. A broad worldwide expansion\\r\\nof capital investment not offset by a rising worldwide propensity to save would\\r\\npresumably move real long-term interest rates higher. Moreover, with term\\r\\npremiums at historical lows, further downward pressure on long-term rates from\\r\\nthis source is unlikely. \\n* * *\\nWe collectively\\r\\nconfront many risks beyond those that I have just mentioned. As was tragically\\r\\nevidenced again by the bombings in London earlier this month, terrorism and\\r\\ngeopolitical risk have become enduring features of the global landscape.\\r\\nAnother prominent concern is the growing evidence of anti-globalization\\r\\nsentiment and protectionist initiatives, which, if implemented, would significantly\\r\\nthreaten the flexibility and resilience of many economies. This situation is\\r\\nespecially troubling for the United States, where openness and flexibility have\\r\\nallowed us to absorb a succession of large shocks in recent years with only\\r\\nminimal economic disruption. That flexibility is, in large measure, a\\r\\ntestament to the industry and resourcefulness of our workers and businesses.\\r\\nBut our success in this dimension has also been aided importantly by more than\\r\\ntwo and a half decades of bipartisan effort aimed at reducing unnecessary\\r\\nregulation and promoting the openness of our market economy. Going forward,\\r\\npolicymakers will need to be vigilant to preserve this flexibility, which has\\r\\ncontributed so constructively to our economic performance in recent years.\\nIn conclusion, Mr.\\r\\nChairman, despite the challenges that I have highlighted and the many I have\\r\\nnot, the U.S. economy has remained on a firm footing, and inflation continues\\r\\nto be well contained. Moreover, the prospects are favorable for a continuation\\r\\nof those trends. Accordingly, the Federal Open Market Committee in its June\\r\\nmeeting reaffirmed that it\\n\".\\r\\n. . believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely\\r\\nto be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic\\r\\nprospects as needed to fulfill its obligation']\n"

      "[\"I reported that conditions had become a good deal more supportive of economic expansion over the previous few months.  A notable reduction in geopolitical concerns, strengthening confidence in economic prospects, and an improvement in financial conditions boded well for spending and production over the second half of the year.  Still, convincing signs of a sustained acceleration in activity were not yet in evidence.  Since then, the picture has brightened.  The gross domestic product expanded vigorously over the second half of 2003 while productivity surged, prices remained stable, and financial conditions improved further.  Overall, the economy has made impressive gains in output and real incomes; however, progress in creating jobs has been limited.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLooking forward, the prospects are good for sustained expansion of the U.S. economy.  The household sector's financial condition is stronger, and the business sector has made substantial strides in bolstering balance sheets.  Narrowing credit risk spreads and a considerable rally in equity prices have reduced financing costs and increased household wealth, which should provide substantial support for spending by businesses and households.  With short-term real interest rates close to zero, monetary policy remains highly accommodative.  And it appears that the impetus from fiscal policy will stay expansionary, on net, through this year.  These circumstances all should spur the expansion of aggregate demand in 2004.  At the same time, increases in efficiency and a significant level of underutilized resources should help keep a lid on inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn retrospect, last year appears to have marked a transition from an extended period of subpar economic performance to one of more vigorous expansion.  Once again, household spending was the mainstay, with real personal consumption spending increasing nearly 4 percent and real outlays on residential structures rising about 10 percent.  Last year's reductions in personal income tax rates and the advance of rebates to those households that were eligible for the expanded child tax credit boosted the growth of real disposable personal income.  The very low level of interest rates also encouraged household spending through a variety of channels.  Automakers took advantage of low interest rates to offer attractive incentive deals, buoying the purchase of new vehicles.  The lowest home mortgage rates in decades were a major contributor to record sales of existing residences, engendering a large extraction of cash from home equity.  A significant part of that cash supported personal consumption expenditures and home improvement.  In addition, many households took out cash in the process of refinancing, often using the proceeds to substitute for higher-cost consumer debt.  That refinancing also permitted some households to lower the monthly carrying costs for their homes and thus freed up funds for other expenditures.  Not least, the low mortgage rates spurred sales and starts of new homes to very high levels.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThese developments were reflected in household financing patterns.  Home mortgage debt increased about 13 percent last year, while consumer credit expanded much more slowly.  Even though the ratio of overall household debt to income continued to increase, as it has for more than a half-century, the rise in home and equity prices enabled the ratio of household net worth to disposable income to recover to a little above its long-term average.  The low level of interest rates and large volume of mortgage refinancing activity helped reduce households' debt-service and financial-obligation ratios a bit.  And many measures of consumer credit quality improved over the year, with delinquency rates on consumer loans and home mortgages declining.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strengthening in capital spending over 2003 contributed importantly to the acceleration of real output.  In the first quarter of the year, business fixed investment extended the downtrend that began in early 2001.  Capital spending, however, ramped up considerably over the final three quarters of 2003, reflecting a pickup in expenditures for equipment and software.  Outlays for high-tech equipment showed particular vigor last year.  Even spending on communications equipment, which had been quite soft in the previous two years, accelerated.  A growing confidence of business executives in the durability of the expansion, strong final sales, the desire to renew capital stocks after replacements had been postponed, and favorable financial conditions all contributed to the turnaround in equipment spending.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, expenditures on nonresidential structures continued to contract on balance, albeit less rapidly than in 2001 and 2002.  High vacancy rates for office buildings and low rates of capacity utilization in manufacturing evidently limited the demand for new structures.  Inventory investment likewise failed to pick up much momentum over the year, as managers remained cautious.  Firms finished 2003 with lean inventories relative to sales, an encouraging sign for the expansion of production going forward.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo a considerable degree, the gathering strength of capital spending reflects a substantial improvement in the financial condition of businesses over the past few years.  Firms' profits rose steeply during 2003 following smaller gains in the previous two years.  The significantly stronger cash flow generated by profits and depreciation allowances was more than adequate to cover rising capital expenditures in the aggregate.  As a result, businesses had little need to borrow during 2003.  For the nonfinancial business sector as a whole, debt is estimated to have grown just 3-1/2 percent.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFirms encountered very receptive conditions in longer-term credit markets in 2003.  Interest rate spreads on both investment-grade and speculative-grade bond issues narrowed substantially over the year, as investors apparently became more confident about the economic expansion and saw less risk of adverse shocks from accounting and other corporate scandals.  Corporate treasurers took advantage of the attractive market conditions by issuing long-term debt to lengthen the maturities of corporate liabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a consequence, net short-term financing was extremely weak.  The stock of business loans extended by banks and commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms declined more than $100 billion over the year, apparently owing to slack demand for short-term credit rather than to a constriction in supply.  Interest-rate spreads on commercial paper, like those on corporate bonds, were quite narrow.  And although a Federal Reserve survey indicates that banks had continued to tighten lending conditions early in the year, by the second half, terms and standards were being eased noticeably.  Moreover, responses to that survey pointed to a lack of demand for business loans until late in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly as a result of the balance-sheet restructuring, business credit quality appears to have recuperated considerably over the past few years.  Last year, the default rate on bonds fell sharply, recovery rates on defaulted issues rose, the number of rating downgrades moderated substantially, and delinquencies on business loans continued to decline.  The improved balance sheets and strong profits of business firms, together with attractive terms for financing in open markets and from banks, suggest that financial conditions remain quite supportive of further gains in capital spending in coming quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe profitability of the business sector was again propelled by stunning increases in productivity.  The advance in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector picked up to\\r\\n5-1/4 percent in 2003 after unusually brisk gains in the previous two years.  The productivity performance of the past few years has been particularly striking in that these increases occurred in a period of relatively sluggish output growth.  The vigorous advance in efficiency represents a notable extension of the pickup that started around the mid-1990s.  Apparently, businesses are still reaping the benefits of the marked acceleration in technology.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe strong gains in productivity, however, have obviated robust increases in business payrolls.  To date, the expansion of employment has significantly lagged increases in output.  Gross separations from employment, two-fifths of which have been involuntary, are about what would be expected from past cyclical experience, given the current pace of output growth.  New hires and recalls from layoffs, however, are far below what historical experience indicates.  To a surprising degree, firms seem able to continue identifying and implementing new efficiencies in their production processes and thus have found it possible so far to meet increasing orders without stepping up hiring. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn all likelihood, employment will begin to grow more quickly before long as output continues to expand.  Productivity over the past few years has probably received a boost from the efforts of businesses to work off the stock of inefficiencies that had accumulated in the boom years.  As those opportunities to enhance efficiency become scarcer and as managers become more confident in the durability of the expansion, firms will surely once again add to their payrolls.\\r\\n\\r\\nA consequence of the rapid gains in productivity and slack in our labor and product markets has been sustained downward pressure on inflation.  As measured by the chain-weighted price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, prices rose less than 1 percent in 2003.  Given the biases in such indexes, this performance puts measured inflation in a range consistent with price stability--a statutory objective of the Federal Reserve and a key goal of all central banks because it is perceived as a prerequisite for maximum sustainable economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent performance of inflation has been especially notable in view of the substantial depreciation of the dollar in 2003.  Against a broad basket of currencies of our trading partners, the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar has declined about 13 percent from its peak in early 2002.  Ordinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in dollar prices of imported goods and services, because foreign exporters endeavor to avoid experiencing price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Reflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and services imported into the United States have begun to rise after declining on balance for several years, but the turnaround to date has been mild.  Apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to absorb some of the price decline measured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on profit margins it entails.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of exporters' losses, however, have apparently been offset by short forward positions against the dollar in foreign exchange markets.  A marked increase in foreign exchange derivative trading, especially in dollar-euro, is consistent with significant hedging of exports to the United States and to other markets that use currencies tied to the U.S. dollar.  However, most contracts are short-term because long-term hedging is expensive.  Thus, although hedging may delay the adjustment, it cannot eliminate the consequences of exchange rate change.  Accordingly, the currency depreciation that we have experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as foreign producers export less to the United States.  On the other side of the ledger, the current account should improve as U.S. firms find the\", \"for the U.S. economy look quite favorable, we need to remind ourselves that all forecasts are projections into an uncertain future.  The fact that most professional forecasters perceive much the same benign short-term outlook that is our most likely expectation provides scant comfort.  When the future surprises, history tells us, it often surprises us all.  We must, as a consequence, remain alert to risks that could threaten the sustainability of the expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the chronic concern about a sharp spike in oil or natural gas prices, a number of risks can be identified.  Of particular importance to monetary policy makers is the possibility that our stance could become improperly calibrated to evolving economic developments.  To be sure, the Federal Open Market Committee's current judgment is that its accommodative posture is appropriate to foster sustainable expansion of economic activity.  But the evidence indicates clearly that such a policy stance will not be compatible indefinitely with price stability and sustainable growth; the real federal funds rate will eventually need to rise toward a more neutral level.  However, with inflation very low and substantial slack in the economy, the Federal Reserve can be patient in removing its current policy accommodation. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the process of assessing risk, we monitor a broad range of economic and financial indicators.  Included in this group are a number of measures of liquidity and credit creation in the economy.  By most standard measures, aggregate liquidity does not appear excessive.  The monetary aggregate M2 expanded only 5-1/4 percent during 2003, somewhat less than nominal GDP, and actually contracted during the fourth quarter.  The growth of nonfederal debt, at 7-3/4 percent, was relatively brisk in 2003.  However, a significant portion of that growth was associated with the record turnover of existing homes and the high level of cash-out refinancing, which are not expected to continue at their recent pace.  A narrower measure, that of credit held by banks, also grew only moderately in 2003.  All told, our accommodative monetary policy stance to date does not seem to have generated excessive volumes of liquidity or credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, as we evaluate the risks to the economy, we also assess developments in financial markets.  Broad measures of equity prices rose 25 percent in 2003, and technology stocks increased twice as quickly.  The rally has extended into this year.  And as I noted previously, credit spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed considerably, particularly for speculative-grade issues.  This performance of financial markets importantly reflects investors' response to robust earnings growth and the repair of business balance sheets over the past few years.  However, history shows that pricing financial assets appropriately in real time can be extremely difficult and that, even in a seemingly benign economic environment, risks remain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outlook for the federal budget deficit is another critical issue for policymakers in assessing our intermediate- and long-run growth prospects and the risks to those prospects.  As you are well aware, after a brief period of unified budget surpluses around the beginning of this decade, the federal budget has reverted to deficits.  The unified deficit swelled to $375 billion in fiscal 2003 and appears to be widening considerably further in the current fiscal year.  In part, these deficits are a result of the economic downturn and the period of slower growth that we recently experienced, as well as the earlier decline in equity prices.  The deficits also reflect fiscal actions specifically intended to provide stimulus to the economy, a significant step-up in spending for national security, and a tendency toward diminished restraint on discretionary spending.  Of course, as economic activity continues to expand, tax revenues should strengthen and the deficit will tend to narrow, all else being equal.  But even budget projections that attempt to take such business-cycle influences into account, such as those from the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, indicate that very sizable deficits are in prospect in the years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have noted before, the debate over budget priorities appears to be between those advocating additional tax cuts and those advocating increased spending.  Although some stirrings in recent weeks in the Congress and elsewhere have been directed at actions that would lower forthcoming deficits, to date no effective constituency has offered programs to balance the budget.  One critical element--present in the 1990s but now absent--is a framework of procedural rules to help fiscal policy makers make the difficult decisions that are required to forge a better fiscal balance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe imbalance in the federal budgetary situation, unless addressed soon, will pose serious longer-term fiscal difficulties.  Our demographics--especially the retirement of the baby-boom generation beginning in just a few years--mean that the ratio of workers to retirees will fall substantially.  Without corrective action, this development will put substantial pressure on our ability in coming years to provide even minimal government services while maintaining entitlement benefits at their current level, without debilitating increases in tax rates.  The longer we wait before addressing these imbalances, the more wrenching the fiscal adjustment ultimately will be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fiscal issues that we face pose long-term challenges, but federal budget deficits could cause difficulties even in the relatively near term.  Long-term interest rates reflect not only the balance between the current demand for, and current supply of, credit, they also incorporate markets' expectations of those balances in the future.  As a consequence, should investors become significantly more doubtful that the Congress will take the necessary fiscal measures, an appreciable backup in long-term interest rates is possible as prospects for outsized federal demands on national saving become more apparent.  Such a development could constrain investment and other interest-sensitive spending and thus undermine the private capital formation that is a key element in our economy's growth prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAddressing the federal budget deficit is even more important in view of the widening U.S. current account deficit.  In 2003, the current account deficit reached $550 billion--about 5 percent of nominal GDP.  The current account deficit and the federal budget deficit are related because the large federal dissaving represented by the budget deficit, together with relatively low rates of U.S. private saving, implies a need to attract saving from abroad to finance domestic private investment spending. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the U.S. current account deficit has been financed with little difficulty.   Although the foreign exchange value of the dollar has fallen over the past year, the decline generally has been gradual, and no material adverse side effects have been visible in U.S. capital markets.  While demands for dollar-denominated assets by foreign private investors are off their record pace of mid-2003, such investors evidently continue to perceive the United States as an excellent place to invest, no doubt owing, in large part, to our vibrant market system and our economy's very strong productivity performance.  Moreover, some governments have accumulated large amounts of dollar-denominated debt as a byproduct of resisting upward exchange rate adjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, given the already-substantial accumulation of dollar-denominated debt, foreign investors, both private and official, may become less willing to absorb ever-growing claims on U.S. residents.  Taking steps to increase our national saving through fiscal action to lower federal budget deficits would help diminish the risks that a further reduction in the rate of purchase of dollar assets by foreign investors could severely crimp the business investment that is crucial for our long-term growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large current account deficits and the associated substantial trade deficits pose another imperative--the need to maintain the degree of flexibility that has been so prominent a force for U.S. economic stability in recent years.  The greatest current threat to that flexibility is protectionism, a danger that has become increasingly visible on today's landscape.  Over the years, protected interests have often endeavored to stop in its tracks the process of unsettling economic change.  Pitted against the powerful forces of market competition, virtually all such efforts have failed.  The costs of any new protectionist initiatives, in the context of wide current account imbalances, could significantly erode the flexibility of the global economy.  Consequently, creeping protectionism must\", 'in recent years the U.S. economy has demonstrated considerable resilience to adversity.  It has overcome significant shocks that, in the past, could have hobbled growth for a much longer period than they have in the current cycle.  As I have noted previously, the U.S. economy has become far more flexible over the past two decades, and associated improvements have played a key role in lessening the effects of the recent adverse developments on our economy.  Looking forward, the odds of sustained robust growth are good, although, as always, risks remain.  The Congress can help foster sustainable expansion by taking steps to reduce federal budget deficits and thus contribute to national saving and by continuing to pursue opportunities to open markets and promote trade.  For our part, the Federal Reserve intends to use its monetary tools to promote our goals of economic growth and maximum employment of our resources in an environment']\n"

      "[\"in the United States have generally been quite favorable in 2004, lending increasing support to the view that the expansion is self-sustaining.  Not only has economic activity quickened, but the expansion has become more broad-based and has produced notable gains in employment.  The evident strengthening in demand that underlies this improved performance doubtless has been a factor contributing to the rise in inflation this year.  But inflation also seems to have been boosted by transitory factors such as the surge in energy prices.  Those higher prices, by eroding households' disposable income, have accounted for at least some of the observed softness in consumer spending of late, a softness which should prove short-lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tWhen I testified before this Committee in February, many of the signs of the step-up in economic activity were already evident.  Capital spending had increased markedly in the second half of last year, no doubt spurred by significantly improving profits, a low cost of capital, and the investment tax incentives enacted in 2002 and enhanced in 2003.  The renewed strength in capital spending carried over into the first half of 2004.  Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods have been on the rise, and backlogs of unfilled orders for new equipment continue to build.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tA key element of the expansion that was still lacking in February, however, was evidence that businesses were willing to ramp up hiring to meet the stepped-up pace of sales and production.  Businesses' ability to boost output without adding appreciably to their workforces likely resulted from a backlog of unexploited capabilities for enhancing productivity with minimal capital investment, which was an apparent outgrowth of the capital goods boom of the 1990s.  Indeed, over much of the previous three years, managers had seemed to pursue every avenue to avoid new hiring despite rising business sales.  Their hesitancy to assume risks and expand employment was accentuated and extended by the corporate accounting and governance scandals that surfaced in the aftermath of the decline in stock prices and also, of course, by the environment of heightened geopolitical tensions.  Even now, following the pattern of recent quarters, corporate investment in fixed capital and inventories apparently continues to fall short of cash flow.  The protracted nature of this shortfall is unprecedented over the past three decades.  Moreover, the proportion of temporary hires relative to total employment continues to rise, underscoring that business caution remains a feature of the economic landscape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThat said, there have been much clearer indications over recent months that conditions in the labor market are improving.  Most notably, gains in private nonfarm payroll employment have averaged about 200,000 per month over the past six months, up sharply from the pace of roughly 60,000 per month registered over the fourth quarter of 2003.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThe improvement in labor market conditions will doubtless have important follow-on effects for household spending.  Expanding employment should provide a lift to personal disposable income, adding to the support stemming from cuts in personal income taxes over the past year.  In addition, the low interest rates of recent years have allowed many households to lower the burdens of their financial obligations.  Although mortgage rates are up from recent lows, they remain quite attractive from a longer-run perspective and are providing solid support to home sales.  Despite the softness of recent retail sales, the combination of higher current and anticipated future income, strengthened balance sheets, and still-low interest rates bodes well for consumer spending.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tConsumer prices excluding food and energy--so-called core prices--have been rising more rapidly this year than in 2003.  For example, the twelve-month change in the core personal consumption expenditures price index stood at 0.8 percent in December of last year and climbed to 1.6 percent by May of this year.  Core inflation, of course, has been elevated by the indirect effects of higher energy prices on business costs and by increases in non-oil import prices that reflect past dollar depreciation and the surge in global prices for primary commodities.  But the acceleration of core prices has been augmented by a marked rise in profit margins, even excluding domestic energy corporations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThis surge in profits reflects, at least in part, the recent recovery of demand after a couple of years during which weak demand led to relatively heavy price discounting by businesses.  Profits of nonfinancial corporations as a share of sector output, after falling to 7 percent in the third quarter of 2001, rebounded to 12 percent in the first quarter of 2004, a pace of advance not experienced since 1983.  Half of this rise in the profit share occurred between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, a period during which business costs were unusually subdued.  In fact, consolidated unit costs for the nonfinancial corporate business sector actually declined during this period.  The increase in output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate business sector of more than 6 percent accounted for much of the net decline in unit costs.  The remainder was due to the effects of rising output in reducing nonlabor fixed costs per unit of output.  Hence, at least from an accounting perspective, between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, all of the 1.1 percent increase in the prices of final goods and services produced in the nonfinancial corporate sector can be attributed to a rise in profit margins rather than rising cost pressures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tHowever, businesses are limited in the degree to which they can raise margins by raising prices.  An increase in margins should affect mainly the level of prices associated with any given level of unit costs but, by itself, should not prompt a sustained pickup in the rate of inflation going forward.  In a market economy, any tendency for profit margins to continue to rise is countered largely by the entry of new competitors willing to undercut prices and by increased labor costs as more firms attempt to exploit the opportunity for outsized profits by expanding employment and output.  That increase in competitive pressure, as history has amply demonstrated, with time, returns markups to more normal levels.  \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tOver the past three decades, the share of the profits of nonfinancial corporations in the total nominal income of that sector has fluctuated around a longer-run average of roughly \\r\\n10-1/2 percent.  The profit share in the first quarter of this year, at about 12 percent, was well above that level.  The gap suggested that the growth of unit profits would eventually slow relative to increases in unit costs.  This outlook had accorded with analysts' expectations for earnings growth over the next year, which are substantially below the realized growth of profits in recent quarters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tIndeed, some leveling or downward pressure on profit margins may already be in train, owing to a pickup in unit labor costs.  Although advances in productivity are continuing at a rate above the long-term average, they have slowed from the extraordinary pace of last summer and are now running below increases in hourly compensation.  The available information suggests that hourly compensation has been increasing at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 percent in the first half of the year.  To be sure, the increases in average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers have been subdued in recent months and barely budged in June.  But other compensation has accelerated this year, reflecting continued sizable increases in health insurance costs, a sharp increase in business contributions to pension funds, and an apparently more robust rate of growth of hourly earnings of supervisory workers.  The larger wage gains for supervisory workers together with anecdotal reports of growing skill shortages are consistent with earlier evidence of rising wage premiums for skilled workers relative to less-skilled workers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor the moment, the modest upward path of unit labor costs does not appear to threaten longer-term price stability, especially if current exceptionally high profit margins begin to come under more intense competitive pressures at home and from abroad.  Although some signs of protectionist sentiment have emerged, there is little evidence that the price-containing forces of ever-widening global competition have ebbed.  In addition, the economy is not yet operating at its productive capacity, which should help to contain cost pressures.  But we cannot be certain that this benign environment will persist and that there are not more deep-seated forces emerging as a consequence of prolonged monetary accommodation.  Accordingly, in assessing the appropriateness of the stance of policy, the Federal Reserve will pay close attention to incoming data, especially on costs and prices.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tWhat does seem clear is that the concerns about the remote possibility of deflation that had been critical in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last year can now be safely set aside.  Those deflationary pressures were largely a consequence of the stock market slump, the capital goods contraction that commenced in 2000, and, as I noted earlier, the extreme business caution that followed from these events as well as from terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and the lead-up to the war in Iraq.  Both equity prices and capital goods spending have turned up over the past year, and the probability that economic activity might stagnate has receded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tAs always, considerable uncertainties remain about the pace of the expansion and the path of inflation.  Some of those uncertainties, especially ones associated with potential terrorism both here and abroad, are difficult to quantify.  Such possibilities have threatened the balance of world supply and demand in oil markets in recent months, especially as demand has risen with the pace of world economic growth.  Yet aside from energy, markets exhibit little evidence of heightened perceptions of risk.  Credit spreads remain low, and market-based indicators of inflation expectations, after rising earlier this year, have receded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith the growth of aggregate demand looking more sustainable and with employment expanding broadly, the considerable monetary accommodation put in place starting in 2001 is becoming increasingly unnecessary.  In May, the FOMC believed that policy accommodation needed to be removed and that removal could be accomplished at a pace that is likely to be measured.  At our meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 1 percent to 1-1/4 percent, and the discount rate was raised commensurately.  Policymakers reiterated that, based on our current outlook, the removal of accommodation would likely proceed at a measured pace.  But in light of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the anticipated evolution of price pressures, the FOMC emphasized that it will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tIf economic developments are such that monetary policy neutrality can be restored at a measured pace, a relatively smooth adjustment of businesses and households to a more typical level of interest rates seems likely.  Even if economic developments dictate that the stance of policy must be adjusted in a less gradual manner to ensure price stability, our economy appears to have prepared itself for a more dynamic adjustment of interest rates.  Of course, considerably more uncertainty and hence risk surrounds the behavior of the economy with a more rapid tightening of monetary policy than is the case when tightening is more measured.  In either scenario, individual instances of financial strain cannot be ruled out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThe protracted period of low interest rates has facilitated a restructuring of household and business balance sheets.  Businesses have been able to fund longer-term debt at highly favorable interest rates and, by extending the maturity of their liabilities, have rendered net earnings and capital values less exposed to destabilizing interest rate spikes.  Households have made similar adjustments.  Between mid-2002 and mid-2003, homeowners were able to refinance at lower interest rates almost half of total outstanding home mortgage debt and thereby to substantially reduce monthly debt service payments.  Households also substituted mortgage debt for more-expensive consumer credit.  Moreover, those households and businesses that held long-term investment-grade bonds in that year accumulated realized and unrealized capital gains as long-term rates declined.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tThe FOMC judged this extended period of exceptionally low interest rates to have been helpful in assisting the economy in recovering from a string of adverse shocks.  But\\r\\nin the process of returning the stance of policy to a more neutral setting, at least some of the capital gains on debt instruments registered in recent years will inevitably be reversed.  \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tPrices in financial markets have already adjusted in anticipation of a significant amount of policy tightening, engendering additional alteration of balance sheets in recent months.  An unwinding of carry trades--that is, market positions premised on low short-term financing costs--seems to be under way, at least judging from a pronounced shift in the trading portfolios of primary dealers.  In addition, investors classified as non-commercial have established net short positions in ten-year Treasury note futures in recent months.  Indeed, the swing toward a net short position on ten-year Treasury note futures has been the largest since the inception of the contract in the 1980s, likely offsetting a significant portion of the interest rate exposure of previously established carry trade positions.   \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, the recent increase in market interest rates has slowed the pace of mortgage refinancing and reportedly has precipitated some winding down of leveraged positions among major mortgage market participants.  These circumstances are quite different from the situation prevailing at this time last summer.  Then, record levels of refinancing in the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003 had pushed the duration of mortgage-backed securities (a measure of the price sensitivity of fixed-income instruments to changes in interest rates) to exceptionally low levels.  As mortgage and other long-term rates rebounded last summer, a consequence of rapidly improving economic conditions and the fading of deflationary concerns, refinancing fell sharply, removing most downward pressure on duration.  Holders of mortgage-backed securities endeavoring to hedge the resulting shifts in interest rate gaps moved rapidly to shed Treasuries and receive-fixed interest-rate swaps, and these actions magnified last summer's upturn in long-term interest rates.  In the current environment, by contrast, it appears that the scope for such mortgage hedging effects to greatly amplify an increase in long-term rates is much diminished given the decline in the pace of refinancing and the associated increase in mortgage durations that have already occurred.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLastly, very large fractions of the total outstanding obligations of businesses and households are long-term, fixed-rate debt.  As a result, rising market interest rates will not have much immediate direct effect on business and household debt service burdens.  Indeed, from early 1999 through early 2000, a period when interest rates on new home mortgage originations rose more than 150 basis points, the average interest rate on the total of home mortgage debt outstanding barely moved.  Nonetheless, despite the lock-in of low interest rate costs on a substantial share of household and business liabilities, recent higher market interest rates will, in time, show through into increased charges against household and business income.  To be sure, financial intermediaries and other creditors that extended loans or purchased securities in recent years at relatively low long-term interest rates will sustain capital losses as rates rise.  In general, however, financial intermediaries are profitable and well-capitalized and appear to be well positioned to manage in a rising rate environment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn short, financial markets along with households and businesses seem to be reasonably well prepared to cope with a transition to a more neutral stance of monetary policy.  Some risks necessarily attend this transition, but they are outweighed in our judgment by those that would be associated with maintaining the existing degree of monetary policy accommodation in the current environment.  Although many factors may affect inflation in the short-run, inflation in the long-run, it is important to remind ourselves, is a monetary phenomenon.  \\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tAs we attempt to assess and manage these risks, we need, as always, to be prepared for the unexpected and to respond promptly and flexibly as situations warrant.  But although our actions need to be flexible, our objectives are not.  For twenty-five years, the Federal Reserve has worked to reestablish price stability on a sustained basis.  An environment of price stability allows households and businesses to make decisions that best promote the longer-term growth of our economy and with it our\"]\n"

      "[\"before this committee last July, I noted that, while the growth of economic activity over the first half of the year had been spurred importantly by a swing from rapid inventory drawdown to modest inventory accumulation, that source of impetus would surely wind down in subsequent quarters, as it did.  We at the Federal Reserve recognized that a strengthening of final sales was an essential element of putting the expansion on a firm and sustainable track.  To support such a strengthening, monetary policy was set to continue its accommodative stance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event, final sales continued to grow only modestly, and business outlays remained soft.  Concerns about corporate governance, which intensified for a time, were compounded over the late summer and into the fall by growing geopolitical tensions.  In particular, worries about the situation in Iraq contributed to an appreciable increase in oil prices.  These uncertainties, coupled with ongoing concerns surrounding macroeconomic prospects,  heightened investors' perception of risk and, perhaps, their aversion to such risk.  Equity prices weakened further, the expected volatility of equity prices rose to unusually high levels, spreads on corporate debt and credit default swaps deteriorated, and liquidity in corporate debt markets declined.  The economic data and the anecdotal information suggested that firms were tightly limiting hiring and capital spending and keeping an unusually short leash on inventories.  With capital markets inhospitable and commercial banks firming terms and standards on business loans, corporations relied to an unusual extent on a drawdown of their liquid assets rather than on borrowing to fund their limited expenditures.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy early November, conditions in financial markets had firmed somewhat on reports of improved corporate profitability.  But on November 6, with economic performance remaining subpar, the Federal Open Market Committee chose to ease the stance of monetary policy, reducing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, to 1� percent.  We viewed that action as insurance against the possibility that the still widespread weakness would become entrenched.  With inflation expectations well contained, this additional monetary stimulus seemed to offer worthwhile insurance against the threat of persistent economic weakness and unwelcome substantial declines in inflation from already low levels.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the weeks that followed, financial market conditions continued to improve, but only haltingly.  The additional monetary stimulus and the absence of further revelations of major corporate wrongdoing seemed to provide some reassurance to investors.  Equity prices rose, volatility declined, risk spreads narrowed, and market liquidity increased, albeit not to levels that might be associated with robust economic conditions.  At the same time, mounting concerns about geopolitical risks and energy supplies, amplified by the turmoil in Venezuela, were mirrored by the worrisome surge in oil prices, continued skittishness in financial markets, and substantial uncertainty among businesses about the outlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly as a result, growth of economic activity slowed markedly late in the summer and in the fourth quarter, continuing the choppy pattern that prevailed over the past year.  According to the advance estimate, real GDP expanded at an annual rate of only � percent last quarter after surging 4 percent in the third quarter.  Much of that deceleration reflected a falloff in the production of motor vehicles from the near-record level that had been reached in the third quarter when low financing rates and other incentive programs sparked a jump in sales.  The slowing in aggregate output also reflected aggressive attempts by businesses more generally to ensure that inventories remained under control.  Thus far, those efforts have proven successful in that business inventories, with only a few exceptions, have stayed lean--a circumstance that should help support production this year.  Indeed, after dropping back a bit in the fall, manufacturing activity turned up in December, and reports from purchasing managers suggest that improvement has continued into this year.  Excluding both the swings in auto and truck production and the fluctuations in non-motor-vehicle inventories, economic activity has been moving up in a considerably smoother fashion than has overall real GDP:  Final sales excluding motor vehicles are estimated to have risen at a 2� percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after a similar 1� percent advance in the previous quarter and an average of 2 percent in the first half.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, apart from these quarterly fluctuations, the economy has largely extended the broad patterns of performance that were evident at the time of my July testimony.  Most notably, output has continued to expand, but only modestly.  As previously, overall growth has simultaneously been supported by relatively strong spending by households and weighed down by weak expenditures by businesses.  Importantly, the favorable underlying trends in productivity have continued; despite little change last quarter, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 3� percent over the four quarters of 2002, an impressive gain for a period of generally lackluster economic performance.  One consequence of the combination of sluggish output growth and rapid productivity gains has been that the labor market has remained quite soft.  Employment turned down in the final months of last year, and the unemployment rate moved up, but the report for January was somewhat more encouraging.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother consequence of the strong performance of productivity has been its support of household incomes despite the softness of labor markets.  Those gains in income, combined with very low interest rates and reduced taxes, have permitted relatively robust advances in residential construction and household expenditures.  Indeed, residential construction activity moved up steadily over the year.  And despite large swings in sales, underlying demand for motor vehicles appears to have been well maintained.  Other consumer outlays, financed partly by the large extraction of built-up equity in homes, have continued to trend up.  Most equity extraction--reflecting the realized capital gains on home sales--usually occurs as a consequence of house turnover.  But during the past year, an almost equal amount reflected the debt-financed cash-outs associated with an unprecedented surge in mortgage refinancings.  Such refinancing activity is bound to contract at some point, as average interest rates on outstanding home mortgages converge to interest rates on new mortgages.  However, fixed mortgage rates remain extraordinarily low, and applications for refinancing are not far off their peaks.  Simply processing the backlog of earlier applications will take some time, and this factor alone suggests that refinancing originations and cash-outs will be significant at least through the early part of this year.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo be sure, the mortgage debt of homeowners relative to their income is high by historical norms.  But as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for the mortgage debt of homeowners relative to the corresponding disposable income of that group is well below the high levels of the early 1990s.  Moreover, owing to continued large gains in residential real estate values, equity in homes has continued to rise despite sizable debt-financed extractions.  Adding in the fixed costs associated with other financial obligations, such as rental payments of tenants, consumer installment credit, and auto leases, the total servicing costs faced by households relative to their incomes are below previous peaks and do not appear to be a significant cause for concern at this time.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhile household spending has been reasonably vigorous, we have yet to see convincing signs of a rebound in business outlays.  After having fallen sharply over the preceding two years, new orders for capital equipment stabilized and, for some categories, turned up in nominal terms in 2002.  Investment in equipment and software is estimated to have risen at a 5 percent rate in real terms in the fourth quarter and a subpar 3 percent over the four quarters of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the emergence of a sustained and broad-based pickup in capital spending will almost surely require the resumption of substantial gains in corporate profits.  Profit margins apparently did improve a bit last year, aided importantly by the strong growth in labor productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the path of capital investment will depend not only on market conditions and the prospects for profits and cash flow but also on the resolution of the uncertainties surrounding the business outlook.  Indeed, the heightening of geopolitical tensions has only added to the marked uncertainties that have piled up over the past three years, creating formidable barriers to new investment and thus to a resumption of vigorous expansion of overall economic activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intensification of geopolitical risks makes discerning the economic path ahead especially difficult.  If these uncertainties diminish considerably in the near term, we should be able to tell far better whether we are dealing with a business sector and an economy poised to grow more rapidly--our more probable expectation--or one that is still laboring under persisting strains and imbalances that have been misidentified as transitory.  Certainly, financial conditions would not seem to impose a significant hurdle to a turnaround in business spending. Yields on risk-free Treasury securities have fallen, risk spreads are narrower on corporate bonds, premiums on credit default swaps have retraced most of their summer spike, and liquidity conditions have improved in capital markets.  These factors, if maintained, should eventually facilitate more-vigorous corporate outlays.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf instead, contrary to our expectations, we find that, despite the removal of the Iraq-related uncertainties, constraints to expansion remain, various initiatives for conventional monetary and fiscal stimulus will doubtless move higher on the policy agenda.  But as part of that process, the experience of recent years may be instructive.  As I have testified before this committee in the past, the most significant lesson to be learned from recent American economic history is arguably the importance of structural flexibility and the resilience to economic shocks that it imparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not claim to be able to judge the relative importance of conventional stimulus and increased economic flexibility to our ability to weather the shocks of the past few years.  But the improved flexibility of our economy, no doubt, has played a key role.  That increased flexibility has been in part the result of the ongoing success in liberalizing global trade, a quarter-century of bipartisan deregulation that has significantly reduced rigidities in our markets for energy, transportation, communication, and financial services, and, of course, the dramatic gains in information technology that have markedly enhanced the ability of businesses to address festering economic imbalances before they inflict significant damage.  This improved ability has been facilitated further by the increasing willingness of our workers to embrace innovation more generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is reasonable to surmise that, not only have such measures contributed significantly to the long-term growth potential of the economy this past decade, they also have enhanced its short-term resistance to recession.  That said, we have too little history to measure the extent to which increasing flexibility has boosted the economy's potential and helped damp cyclical fluctuations in activity.\\r\\n \\r\\nEven so, the benefits appear sufficiently large that we should be placing special emphasis on searching for policies that will engender still greater economic flexibility and dismantling policies that contribute to unnecessary rigidity.  The more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct in response to inevitable, often unanticipated, disturbances, thus reducing the size and consequences of cyclical imbalances.  Enhanced flexibility has the advantage of adjustments being automatic and not having to rest on the initiatives of policymakers, which often come too late or are based on highly uncertain forecasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicies intended to improve the flexibility of the economy seem to fall outside the sphere of traditional monetary and fiscal policy.  But decisions on the structure of the tax system and spending programs surely influence flexibility and thus can have major consequences for both the cyclical performance and long-run growth potential of our economy.  Accordingly, in view of the major budget issues now confronting the Congress and their potential implications for the economy, I thought it appropriate to devote some of my remarks today to fiscal policy.  In that regard, I will not be emphasizing specific spending or revenue programs.  Rather, my focus will be on the goals and process determining the budget and on the importance, despite our increasing national security requirements, of regaining discipline in that process.  These views are my own and are not necessarily shared by\", 'of the budget landscape over the past half century has been the limited movement in the ratio of unified budget outlays to nominal GDP.  Over the past five years, that ratio has averaged a bit less than 19 percent, about where it was in the 1960s before it moved up during the 1970s and 1980s.  But that pattern of relative stability over the longer term has masked a pronounced rise in the share of spending committed to retirement, medical, and other entitlement programs.  Conversely, the share of spending that is subject to the annual appropriations process, and thus that comes under regular review by the Congress, has been shrinking.  Such so-called discretionary spending has fallen from two-thirds of total outlays in the 1960s to one-third last year, with defense outlays accounting for almost all of the decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increase in the share of expenditures that is more or less on automatic pilot has complicated the task of making fiscal policy by effectively necessitating an extension of the budget horizon.  The Presidents\\' budgets through the 1960s and into the 1970s mainly provided information for the upcoming fiscal year.  The legislation in 1974 that established a new budget process and created the Congressional Budget Office required that organization to provide five-year budget projections.  And by the mid-1990s, CBO\\'s projection horizon had been pushed out to ten years.  These longer time periods and the associated budget projections, even granted their imprecision, are useful steps toward allowing the Congress to balance budget priorities sensibly in the context of a cash-based accounting system.1   But more can be done to clarify those priorities and thereby enhance the discipline on the fiscal process.\\r\\n\\r\\nA general difficulty concerns the very nature of the unified budget.  As a cash accounting system, it was adopted in 1968 to provide a comprehensive measure of the funds that move in and out of federal coffers.  With a few modifications, it correctly measures the direct effect of federal transactions on national saving.  But a cash accounting system is not designed to track new commitments and their translation into future spending and borrowing.  For budgets that are largely discretionary, changes in forward commitments do not enter significantly into budget deliberations, and hence the surplus or deficit in the unified budget is a reasonably accurate indicator of the stance of fiscal policy and its effect on saving.  But as longer-term commitments have come to dominate tax and spending decisions, such cash accounting has been rendered progressively less meaningful as the principal indicator of the state of our fiscal affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accrual-based accounting system geared to the longer horizon could be constructed with a reasonable amount of additional effort.  In fact, many of the inputs on the outlay side are already available.  However, estimates of revenue accruals are not well developed.  These include deferred taxes on retirement accounts that are taxable on withdrawal, accrued taxes on unrealized capital gains, and corporate tax accruals.  An accrual system would allow us to keep better track of the government\\'s overall accrued obligations and deferred assets.  Future benefit obligations and taxes would be recognized as they are incurred rather than when they are paid out by the government.2\\n\\r\\nCurrently, accrued outlays very likely are much greater than those calculated under the cash-based approach.  Under full accrual accounting, the social security program would be showing a substantial deficit this year, rather than the surplus measured under our current cash accounting regimen.3   Indeed, under most reasonable sets of actuarial assumptions, for social security benefits alone past accruals cumulate to a liability that amounts to many trillions of dollars.  For the government as a whole, such liabilities are still growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimating the liabilities implicit in social security is relatively straightforward because that program has many of the characteristics of a private defined-benefit retirement program.  Projections of Medicare outlays, however, are far more uncertain even though the rise in the beneficiary populations is expected to be similar.  The likelihood of continued dramatic innovations in medical technology and procedures combined with largely inelastic demand and a subsidized third-party payment system engenders virtually open-ended potential federal outlays unless constrained by law.4   Liabilities for Medicare are probably about the same order of magnitude as those for social security, and as is the case for social security, the date is rapidly approaching when those liabilities will be converted into cash outlays.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccrual-based accounts would lay out more clearly the true costs and benefits of changes to various taxes and outlay programs and facilitate the development of a broad budget strategy.  In doing so, these accounts should help shift the national dialogue and consensus toward a more realistic view of the limits of our national resources as we approach the next decade and focus attention on the necessity to make difficult choices from among programs that, on a stand-alone basis, appear very attractive.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the baby boomers have not yet started to retire in force and accordingly the ratio of retirees to workers is still relatively low, we are in the midst of a demographic lull.  But short of an outsized acceleration of productivity to well beyond the average pace of the past seven years or a major expansion of immigration, the aging of the population now in train will end this state of relative budget tranquility in about a decade\\'s time.  It would be wise to address this significant pending adjustment sooner rather than later.  As the President\\'s just-released budget put it, \"The longer the delay in enacting reforms, the greater the danger, and the more drastic the remedies will have to be.\"5\\n\\r\\nAccrual-based revenue and outlay projections, tied to a credible set of economic assumptions, tax rates, and programmatic spend-out rates, can provide important evidence on the long-term sustainability of the overall budget and economic regimes under alternative scenarios.6   Of course, those projections, useful as they might prove to be, would still be subject to enormous uncertainty.  The ability of economists to assess the effects of tax and spending programs is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the forces influencing the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that much controversy over basic questions surrounds the current debate over budget policy.  Do budget deficits and debt significantly affect interest rates and, hence, economic activity?  With political constraints on the size of acceptable deficits, do tax cuts ultimately restrain spending increases, and do spending increases limit tax cuts?  To what extent do tax increases inhibit investment and economic growth or, by raising national saving, have the opposite effect?  And to what extent does government spending raise the growth of GDP, or is its effect offset by a crowding out of private spending?\\r\\n\\r\\nSubstantial efforts are being made to develop analytical tools that, one hopes, will enable us to answer such questions with greater precision than we can now.  Much progress has been made in ascertaining the effects of certain policies, but many of the more critical questions remain in dispute.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there should be little disagreement about the need to reestablish budget discipline.  The events of September 11 have placed demands on our budgetary resources that were unanticipated a few years ago.  In addition, with defense outlays having fallen in recent years to their smallest share of GDP since before World War II, the restraint on overall spending from the downtrend in military outlays has surely run its course--and likely would have done so even without the tragedy of September 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBO and the Office of Management and Budget recently released updated budget projections that are sobering.  These projections, in conjunction with the looming demographic pressures, underscore the urgency of extending the budget enforcement rules.  To be sure, in the end, it is policy, not process, that counts.  But the statutory limits on discretionary spending and the so-called PAYGO rules, which were promulgated in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and were backed by a sixty-vote point of order in the Senate, served as useful tools for controlling deficits through much of the 1990s.  These rules expired in the House last September and have been partly extended in the Senate only through mid-April.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Budget Enforcement Act was intended to address the problem of huge unified deficits and was enacted in the context of a major effort to bring the budget under control.  In 1990, the possibility that surpluses might emerge within the decade seemed remote indeed.  When they unexpectedly arrived, the problem that the budget control measures were designed to address seemed to have been solved.  Fiscal discipline became a less pressing priority and was increasingly abandoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make the budget process more effective, some have suggested amending the budget rules to increase their robustness against the designation of certain spending items as \"emergency\" and hence not subject to the caps.  Others have proposed mechanisms, such as statutory triggers and sunsets on legislation, that would allow the Congress to make mid-course corrections more easily if budget projections go off-track--as they invariably will.  These ideas are helpful and they could strengthen the basic structure established a decade ago.  But, more important, a budget framework along the lines of the one that provided significant and effective discipline in the past needs, in my judgment, to be reinstated without delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am concerned that, should the enforcement mechanisms governing the budget process not be restored, the resulting lack of clear direction and constructive goals would allow the inbuilt political bias in favor of growing budget deficits to again become entrenched.  We are all too aware that government spending programs and tax preferences can be easy to initiate or expand but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shut down once constituencies develop that have a stake in maintaining the status quo.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Congress\\'s review of the mechanisms governing the budget process, you may want to reconsider whether the statutory limit on the public debt is a useful device.  As a matter of arithmetic, the debt ceiling is either redundant or inconsistent with the paths of revenues and outlays you specify when you legislate a budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, a technical correction in the procedure used to tie indexed benefits and individual income tax brackets to changes in \"the cost of living\" as required by law is long overdue.  As you may be aware, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has recently introduced a new price index--the so-called chained CPI.  The new index is based on the same underlying data as is the official CPI, but it combines the individual prices in a way that better measures changes in the cost of living.  In particular, the chained CPI captures more fully than does the official CPI the way that consumers alter the mix of their expenditures in response to changes in relative prices.  Because it appears to offer a more accurate measure of the true cost of living--the statutory intent--the chained CPI would be a more suitable series for the indexation of federal programs.  Had such indexing been in place during the past decade, the fiscal 2002 deficit would have been $40 billion smaller, all else being equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the present time, there seems to be a large and growing constituency for holding down the deficit, but I sense less appetite to do what is required to achieve that outcome.  Reestablishing budget balance will require discipline on both revenue and spending actions, but restraint on spending may prove the more difficult.  Tax cuts are limited by the need for the federal government to fund a basic level of services--for example, national defense.  No such binding limits constrain spending.  If spending growth were to outpace nominal GDP, maintaining budget balance would necessitate progressively higher tax rates that would eventually inhibit the growth in the revenue base on which those rates are imposed.  Deficits, possibly ever widening, would be the inevitable outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaster economic growth, doubtless, would make deficits far easier to contain.  But faster economic growth alone is not likely to be the full solution to currently projected long-term deficits.  To be sure, underlying productivity has accelerated considerably in recent years.   Nevertheless, to assume that productivity can continue to accelerate to rates well above the current underlying pace would be a stretch, even for our very dynamic economy.7   So, short of a major increase in immigration, economic growth cannot be safely counted upon to eliminate deficits and the difficult choices that will be required to restore fiscal discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the same token, in setting budget priorities and policies, attention must be paid to the attendant consequences for the real economy.  Achieving budget balance, for example, through actions that hinder economic growth is scarcely a measure of success.  We need to develop policies that increase the real resources that will be available to meet our longer-run needs.  The greater the resources available--that is, the greater the output of goods and services produced by our economy--the easier will be providing real benefits to retirees in coming decades without unduly restraining', \"times for all policymakers.  Considerable uncertainties surround the economic outlook, especially in the period immediately ahead.  But the economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of a succession of substantial blows.  Critical to our nation's performance over the past few years has been the flexibility exhibited by our market-driven economy and its ability to generate substantial increases in productivity.  Going forward, these same characteristics, in concert with sound economic policies, should help to foster a return to vigorous growth of the U.S. economy to the benefit\"]\n"

      "[\"I noted that the economic expansion over the preceding \\r\\n        year had been modest. Spending by households had contributed importantly \\r\\n        to the gains in economic activity. The nation's strong underlying productivity \\r\\n        performance was providing ongoing support for household income. That rise \\r\\n        in income, combined with low interest rates, reduced taxes, and the availability \\r\\n        of substantial home equity, had spurred solid gains in consumer spending \\r\\n        and a robust advance in residential construction. \\nIn contrast, although the contraction in capital spending appeared to \\r\\n        have slowed, we had yet to see any convincing signs that a sustained pickup \\r\\n        in business spending was emerging. Moreover, heightened geopolitical tensions \\r\\n        were adding to the already considerable uncertainties that had clouded \\r\\n        the business outlook over the preceding three years. The general climate \\r\\n        of caution in the business sector was manifest in a number of ways, including \\r\\n        restrained hiring, a reluctance to invest in new capacity, and aggressive \\r\\n        actions to maintain low levels of inventories. \\nIn late February and early March, the risks and uncertainties surrounding \\r\\n        the economic outlook intensified as the range of possibilities for the \\r\\n        timing, duration, and economic consequences of the pending war in Iraq \\r\\n        appeared to widen. In financial markets, a greater sense of caution among \\r\\n        investors seemed to bolster the demand for Treasury and other fixed-income \\r\\n        securities at the expense of equities; the price of crude oil moved up, \\r\\n        as did the prices of gasoline and home heating oil; and consumer confidence \\r\\n        sagged further. After picking up in January, payroll employment and manufacturing \\r\\n        production turned down again in February and March. \\nWhen the onset of the war became imminent, financial markets rallied, \\r\\n        and the price of crude oil dropped back. Market participants seemed buoyed \\r\\n        simply by the elimination of uncertainty about the timing of the start, \\r\\n        and hence the end of hostilities, although a still-significant amount \\r\\n        of unease inevitably remained about the way the war might progress and \\r\\n        how severely it might disrupt oil production and economic activity. \\nIn such an environment, we had little ability to distinguish temporary \\r\\n        changes from more persistent shifts in underlying economic trends. For \\r\\n        that reason, the Federal Open Market Committee, at its March 18 meeting, \\r\\n        refrained from making a determination about the balance of risks with \\r\\n        respect to its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic \\r\\n        growth. At the same time, we stepped up our surveillance of economic developments. \\r\\n      \\nAs part of that surveillance, we receive virtually continuous information \\r\\n        from commodity and financial markets. The price of crude oil is now well \\r\\n        below its peak of early March, as the potential for serious supply disruptions \\r\\n        in world oil markets has diminished. Broad equity indexes remain well \\r\\n        above their lows of mid-March and have been boosted most recently by incoming \\r\\n        information on first-quarter earnings that market participants appear \\r\\n        to view as generally positive. \\nIn contrast, six weeks after the beginning of the war, we have only limited \\r\\n        readings on broader economic conditions, and that information has been \\r\\n        mixed. Households appear to have become somewhat less apprehensive about \\r\\n        the economic outlook in recent weeks, though reports from businesses have \\r\\n        not exhibited a similar improvement in tone. Consistent with this, the \\r\\n        persistent high level of new claims for unemployment insurance suggests \\r\\n        that firms may still be finding it possible to meet their customers' tepid \\r\\n        increases in demand with a leaner workforce. \\nGoing forward, some further unwinding of the economic tensions that have \\r\\n        been associated with the situation in Iraq seems likely. As that occurs, \\r\\n        the fundamental trends shaping the economic outlook should emerge more \\r\\n        clearly. As I indicated when I met with you earlier this year, I continue \\r\\n        to believe the economy is positioned to expand at a noticeably better \\r\\n        pace than it has during the past year, though the timing and the extent \\r\\n        of that improvement remains uncertain. Fundamentally, the long-run growth \\r\\n        potential of the economy remains solid. And the enhanced flexibility inherent \\r\\n        in that trend imparts resilience against shocks of the kinds that we have \\r\\n        experienced in the past few years. \\nUnfortunately, the future path of the economy is likely to come into \\r\\n        sharper focus only gradually. In the interim, we need to remain mindful \\r\\n        of the possibility that lingering business caution could be an impediment \\r\\n        to improved economic performance. \\nAs you may know, the consensus of economic forecasters is that a material \\r\\n        rebound in economic activity will develop in the second half of this year, \\r\\n        and certainly a number of elements should be working in that direction. \\r\\n        The recent improvements in financial markets that I noted earlier, if \\r\\n        maintained, would seem to suggest a turnaround in capital spending. In \\r\\n        this regard, the ongoing decline in risk spreads in corporate bond markets \\r\\n        so far this year is an encouraging development. To be sure, spreads remain \\r\\n        high by historical standards, but the constraint imposed by last fall's \\r\\n        huge run-up in risk premiums now appears to have been put largely behind \\r\\n        us. \\nIn addition, businesses should see some relief from the pressure on profit \\r\\n        margins that had developed in recent months as energy prices rose sharply, \\r\\n        and improvement on this front could be a positive development for capital \\r\\n        spending. A modestly encouraging sign is provided by the backlog of orders \\r\\n        for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, which has been moving \\r\\n        up in recent months. Households, too, are likely to welcome lower energy \\r\\n        bills and a continuation of favorable conditions in mortgage and credit \\r\\n        markets. \\nAs you know, core prices by many measures have increased very slowly \\r\\n        over the last six months. With price inflation already at a low level, \\r\\n        substantial further disinflation would be an unwelcome development, especially \\r\\n        to the extent it put pressure on profit margins and impeded the revival \\r\\n        of business spending. \\nThe balance of influences on inflation and economic activity will be \\r\\n        among the subjects of discussion by the Federal Open Market Committee \\r\\n        when\"]\n"

      "[\"I last reviewed the economic outlook before this Committee, full-scale military operations in Iraq had concluded, and there were signs that some of the impediments to brisker growth in economic activity in the months leading up to the conflict were beginning to lift.  Many, though by no means all, of the economic uncertainties stemming from the situation in Iraq had been resolved, and that reduction in uncertainty had left an imprint on a broad range of indicators.\\nStock prices had risen, risk spreads on corporate bonds had narrowed, oil prices had dropped sharply, and measures of consumer sentiment appeared to be on the mend.  But, as I noted in April, hard data indicating that these favorable developments were quickening the pace of spending and production were not yet in evidence, and it was likely that the extent of the underlying vigor of the economy would become apparent only gradually. \\nIn the months since, some of the residual war-related uncertainties have abated further and financial conditions have turned decidedly more accommodative, supported, in part, by the Federal Reserve's commitment to foster sustainable growth and to guard against a substantial further disinflation.  Yields across maturities and risk classes have posted marked declines, which together with improved profits boosted stock prices and household wealth.  If the past is any guide, these domestic financial developments, apart from the heavy dose of fiscal stimulus now in train, should bolster economic activity over coming quarters.\\nTo be sure, industrial production does appear to have stabilized in recent weeks after months of declines.  Consumer spending has held up reasonably well, and activity in housing markets continues strong.  But incoming data on employment and aggregate output remain mixed.  A pervasive sense of caution reflecting, in part, the aftermath of corporate governance scandals appears to have left businesses focused on strengthening their balance sheets and, to date, reluctant to ramp up significantly their hiring and spending.  Continued global uncertainties and economic weakness abroad, particularly among some of our major trading partners, also have extended the ongoing softness in the demand for U.S. goods and services. \\nWhen the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last month, with the economy not yet showing convincing signs of a sustained pickup in growth, and against the backdrop of our concerns about the implications of a possible substantial decline in inflation, we elected to ease policy another quarter-point.  The FOMC stands prepared to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for as long as needed to promote satisfactory economic performance.  In the judgment of the Committee, policy accommodation aimed at raising the growth of output, boosting the utilization of resources, and warding off unwelcome disinflation can be maintained for a considerable period without ultimately\", \"resumption of strong economic growth have been enhanced by steps taken in the private sector over the past couple of years to restructure and strengthen balance sheets.  These changes, assisted by improved prices in asset markets, have left households and businesses better positioned than they were earlier to boost outlays as their wariness about the economic environment abates. \\nNowhere has this process of balance sheet adjustment been more evident than in the household sector.  On the asset side of the balance sheet, the decline in longer-term interest rates and diminished perceptions of credit risk in recent months have provided a substantial lift to the market value of nearly all major categories of household assets.  Most notably, historically low mortgage interest rates have helped to propel a solid advance in the value of the owner-occupied housing stock.  And the lowered rate at which investors discount future business earnings has contributed to the substantial appreciation in broad equity price indexes this year, reversing a portion of their previous declines.\\nIn addition, reflecting growing confidence, households have been shifting the composition of their portfolios in favor of riskier assets.  In recent months, equity mutual funds attracted sizable inflows following the redemptions recorded over much of the last year.  Moreover, strong inflows to corporate bond funds, particularly those specializing in speculative-grade securities, have provided further evidence of a renewed appetite for risk-taking among retail investors. \\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, despite the significant increase in debt encouraged by higher asset values, lower interest rates have facilitated a restructuring of existing debt.  Households have taken advantage of new lows in mortgage interest rates to refinance debt on more favorable terms, to lengthen debt maturity, and, in many cases, to extract equity from their homes to pay down other higher-cost debt.  Debt service burdens, accordingly, have declined.\\nOverall, during the first half of 2003, the net worth of households is estimated to have risen 4-1/2 percent--somewhat faster than the rise in nominal disposable personal income.  Only 15 percent of that increase in wealth represented the accumulated personal saving of households. Additions to net worth have largely reflected capital gains both from financial investments and from home price appreciation.  Net additions to home equity, despite very large extractions, remained positive in the first half.\\nSignificant balance-sheet restructuring in an environment of low interest rates has gone far beyond that experienced in the past.  In large measure, this reflects changes in technology and mortgage markets that have dramatically transformed accumulated home equity from a very illiquid asset into one that is now an integral part of households' ongoing balance-sheet management and spending decisions.  This enhanced capacity doubtless added significant support to consumer markets during the past three years as numerous shocks--a stock price fall, 9/11, and the Iraq war--pummeled consumer sentiment.\\nHouseholds have been able to extract home equity by drawing on home equity loan lines, by realizing capital gains through the sale of existing homes, and by extracting cash as part of the refinancing of existing mortgages, so-called cash-outs.  Although all three of these vehicles have been employed extensively by homeowners in recent years, home turnover has accounted for most equity extraction. \\nSince originations to purchase existing homes tend to be roughly twice as large as repayments of the remaining balances on outstanding mortgages of home sellers, the very high levels of existing home turnover have resulted in substantial equity extraction, largely realized capital gains.  Indeed, of the estimated net increase of $1.1 trillion in home mortgage debt during the past year and a half, approximately half resulted from existing home turnover. \\nThe huge wave of refinancings this year and last has been impressive.  Owing chiefly to the decline in mortgage rates to their lowest levels in more than three decades, estimated mortgage refinancings net of cash-outs last year rose to a record high of more than $1.6 trillion.  With mortgage rates declining further in recent months, the pace of refinancing surged even higher over the first half of this year.  Cash-outs also increased, but at a slowed pace.  Net of duplicate refinancings, approximately half of the dollar value of outstanding regular mortgages has been refinanced during the past year and a half.  Moreover, applications to refinance existing mortgages jumped to record levels last month.  Given that refinance applications lead originations by about five weeks and that current mortgage rates remain significantly below those on existing mortgages, refinance originations likely will remain at an elevated level well into the current quarter.  \\nWe expect both equity extraction and lower debt service to continue to provide support for household spending in the period ahead, though the strength of this support is likely to diminish over time.  In recent quarters, low mortgage rates have carried new home sales and construction to elevated levels.  Sales of new single-family homes through the first five months of this year are well ahead of last year's record pace.  And declines in financing rates on new auto loans to the lowest levels in many years have spurred purchases of\", \"sheet improvements, the recently passed tax legislation will provide a considerable lift to disposable incomes of households in the second half of the year, even after accounting for some state and local offsets.  At this point, most firms have likely implemented the lower withholding schedules that have been released by the Treasury, and advance rebates of child tax credits are being mailed beginning later this month.  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that these and other tax changes should increase households' cash flow in the third quarter by $35 billion.  Most mainstream economic models predict that such tax-induced increases in disposable income should produce a prompt and appreciable pickup in consumer spending.  Moreover, most models would also project positive follow-on effects on capital spending.  The evolution of spending over the next few months may provide an important test of the extent to which this traditional view of expansionary fiscal policy holds\", \"businesses have taken advantage of low interest rates to shore up their balance sheets.  Most notably, firms have issued long-term debt and employed the proceeds to pay down commercial paper, bank loans, and other short-term debt.  Although rates on commercial paper and bank loans are well below yields on new long-term bonds, firms have evidently judged that now is an opportune time to lock in long-term funding and avoid the liquidity risks that can be associated with heavy reliance on short-term funding.  At the same time, the average coupon on outstanding corporate bonds remains considerably above rates on new debt issues, suggesting that firms are well positioned to cut their debt service burdens still further as outstanding bonds mature or are called.  The net effect of these trends to date has been a decline in the ratio of business interest payments to net cash flow, a significant increase in the average maturity of liabilities, and a rise in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities.\\nWith business balance sheets having been strengthened and with investors notably more receptive to risk, the overall climate in credit markets has become more hospitable in recent months.  Specifically, improvements in forward-looking measures of default risk, a decline in actual defaults, and a moderation in the pace of debt-rating downgrades have prompted a marked narrowing of credit spreads and credit default swap premiums.  That change in sentiment has extended even to the speculative-grade bond market, where issuance has revived considerably, even by lower-tier issuers that would have been hard-pressed to tap the capital markets over much of the last few years.  Banks, for their part, remain well-capitalized and willing lenders. \\nIn the past, such reductions in private yields and in the cost of capital faced by firms have been associated with rising capital spending.  But as yet there is little evidence that the more accommodative financial environment has materially improved the willingness of top executives to increase capital investment.  Corporate executives and boards of directors are seemingly unclear, in the wake of the recent intense focus on corporate behavior, about how an increase in risk-taking on their part would be viewed by shareholders and regulators. \\nAs a result, business leaders have been quite circumspect about embarking on major new investment projects.  Moreover, still-ample capacity in some sectors and lingering uncertainty about the strength of prospective final sales have added to the reluctance to expand capital outlays.  But should firms begin to perceive that the pickup in demand is durable, they doubtless would be more inclined to increase hiring and production, replenish depleted inventories, and bring new capital on line.  These actions in turn would tend to further boost incomes and output.  \\nTentative signs suggest that this favorable dynamic may be beginning to take hold.  Industrial production, as I indicated earlier, seems to have stabilized, and various regional and national business surveys point to a recent firming in new orders.  Indeed, the backlog of unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, increased, on net, over the first five months of this year.  Investment in structures, however, continues to weaken.\\nThe outlook for business profits is, of course, a key factor that will help determine whether the stirrings we currently observe in new orders presage a sustained pickup in production and new capital spending.  Investors' outlook for near-term earnings has seemed a little brighter of late. \\nThe favorable productivity trend of recent years, if continued, would certainly bode well for future profitability.  Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2-1/2 percent over the year ending in the first quarter.  It has been unusual that firms have been able to achieve consistently strong gains in productivity when the overall performance of the economy has been so lackluster.  To some extent, companies under pressure to cut costs in an environment of \\r\\nstill-tepid sales growth and an uncertain economic outlook might be expected to search aggressively for ways to employ resources more efficiently.  That they have succeeded, in general, over a number of quarters suggests that a prior accumulation of inefficiencies was available to be eliminated.  One potential source is that from 1995 to 2000 heavy emphasis on new and expanding markets likely diverted corporate management from tight cost controls whose payoffs doubtless seemed small relative to big-picture expansion.  \\nHowever, one consequence of these improvements in efficiency has been an ability of many businesses to pare existing workforces and still meet increases in demand.  Indeed, with the growth of real output below that of labor productivity for much of the period since 2000, aggregate hours and employment have fallen, and the unemployment rate rose last month to 6.4 percent of\", \"indicators are mostly positive, downside risks to the business outlook are also apparent, including the partial rebound in energy costs and some recent signs that aggregate demand may be flagging among some of our important trading partners.  Oil prices, after dropping sharply in March on news that the Iraqi oil fields had been secured, have climbed back above $30 per barrel as market expectations for a quick return of Iraqi production appear to have been overly optimistic given the current security situation. \\nAlso worrisome is the rise in natural gas prices.  Natural gas accounts for a substantial portion of total unit energy costs of production among nonfinancial, non-energy-producing firms. And as I noted in testimony last week, futures markets anticipate that the current shortage in natural gas will persist well into the future.  Although they project a near-term modest decline from highly elevated levels, contracts written for delivery in 2009 in excess of $4.50 per million Btu are still at double the levels that had been contemplated when much of our existing gas-using capital stock was put in place. \\nThe timing and extent of the pickup in economic activity in the United States will also depend on global developments.  Lethargic growth among many of our important global trading partners is posing some downside risk to the U.S. economic outlook.  As has been true for some time, Japan's economy remains in difficult straits, burdened by a weak banking sector and an ongoing deflation, although recent data have seemed somewhat less negative.  Economic activity in many European countries--especially Germany--has been soft of late and has been accompanied by a decline in inflation to quite low levels.  While Japan and Europe should benefit from global economic recovery, the near-term weakness\", 'been important in shaping the economic outlook and the stance of policy over the first half of the year.  With the economy operating below its potential for much of the past two years and productivity growth proceeding apace, measures of core consumer prices have decelerated noticeably.  Allowing for known measurement biases, these inflation indexes have been in a neighborhood that corresponds to effective price stability--a long-held goal assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.  But we can pause at this achievement only for a moment, mindful that we face new challenges in maintaining price stability, specifically to prevent inflation from falling too low.  \\nThis is one reason the FOMC has adopted a quite accommodative stance of policy.  A very low inflation rate increases the risk that an adverse shock to the economy would be more difficult to counter effectively.  Indeed, there is an especially pernicious, albeit remote, scenario in which inflation turns negative against a backdrop of weak aggregate demand, engendering a corrosive deflationary spiral.\\nUntil recently, this topic was often regarded as an academic curiosity.  Indeed, a decade ago, most economists would have dismissed the possibility that a government issuing a fiat currency would ever produce too little inflation.  However, the recent record in Japan has reopened serious discussion of this issue.  To be sure, there are credible arguments that the Japanese experience is idiosyncratic.  But there are important lessons to be learned, and it is incumbent on a central bank to anticipate any contingency, however remote, if significant economic costs could be associated with that contingency. \\nThe Federal Reserve has been studying how to provide policy stimulus should our primary tool of adjusting the target federal funds rate no longer be available.  Indeed, the FOMC devoted considerable attention to this subject at its June meeting, examining potentially feasible policy alternatives.  However, given the now highly stimulative stance of monetary and fiscal policy and well-anchored inflation expectations, the Committee concluded that economic fundamentals are such that situations requiring special policy actions are most unlikely to arise.  Furthermore, with the target funds rate at 1 percent, substantial further conventional easings could be implemented if the FOMC judged such policy actions warranted.  Doubtless, some financial firms would experience difficulties in such an environment, but these intermediaries have exhibited considerable flexibility in the past to changing circumstances.  More broadly, as I indicated earlier, the FOMC stands ready to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for as long as it takes to achieve a return to']\n"

      "[\"last reported to you on the\\r\\nconduct of monetary policy, the U.S. economy has\\r\\ngone through a period of considerable strain, with\\r\\noutput contracting for a time and unemployment rising. \\r\\nWe in the Federal Reserve System acted vigorously to\\r\\nadjust monetary policy in an endeavor both to limit the\\r\\nextent of the downturn and to hasten its completion. \\r\\nDespite the disruptions engendered by the terrorist\\r\\nattacks of September 11, the typical dynamics of the\\r\\nbusiness cycle have re-emerged and are prompting a\\r\\nfirming in economic activity. An array of influences\\r\\nunique to this business cycle, however, seems likely to\\r\\nmoderate the speed of the anticipated recovery.\\nAt the time of our last report, the economy was\\r\\nweakening. Many firms were responding to the\\r\\nrealization that significant overcapacity had developed. \\r\\nThe demand for capital goods had dropped sharply,\\r\\nand inventories were uncomfortably high in many\\r\\nindustries. In response, businesses slashed production,\\r\\nand the resulting declines in incomes amplified the\\r\\ncyclical downturn. Real gross domestic product did\\r\\nnot grow in the second quarter and contracted in the\\r\\nthird.\\n\\n\\nA coincident deceleration in activity among the\\r\\nworld economies was evident over the past year,\\r\\nowing, at least in part, to the retrenchment in the\\r\\nhigh-technology sector and the global reach of the\\r\\ncapital markets in which the firms in that sector are\\r\\nvalued and funded. However, before the terrorist\\r\\nattacks, it was far from obvious that this concurrent\\r\\nweakness was becoming self-reinforcing. Indeed,\\r\\nimmediately prior to September 11, some sectors\\r\\nexhibited tentative signs of stabilization, contributing to\\r\\na hope that the worst of the previous cumulative\\r\\nweakness in world economic activity was nearing an\\r\\nend.\\nThat hope was decisively dashed by the tragic\\r\\nevents of early September. Adding to the intense\\r\\nforces weighing on asset prices and economic activity\\r\\nbefore September 11 were new sources of uncertainty\\r\\nthat began to press down on global demand for goods\\r\\nand services. Economies almost everywhere\\r\\nweakened further, a cause for increasing uneasiness. \\r\\nThe simultaneous further slowing in activity raised\\r\\nconcerns that a self-reinforcing cycle of contraction, fed\\r\\nby perceptions of greater economic risk, could\\r\\ndevelop. Such an event, though rare, would not be\\r\\nunprecedented in business-cycle history.\\n\\n\\nIf ever a situation existed in which the fabric of\\r\\nbusiness and consumer confidence, both here and\\r\\nabroad, was vulnerable to being torn, the shock of\\r\\nSeptember 11 was surely it. In addition to the horrific\\r\\nloss of life, enormous uncertainties accompanied the\\r\\nunfolding events and their implications for the economy. \\r\\nIndeed, for a period of weeks, U.S. economic activity\\r\\ndid drop dramatically in response to that shock.\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the strikes, the\\r\\nFederal Reserve engaged in aggressive action to\\r\\ncounter the effects of the shock on payment systems\\r\\nand financial markets. We provided a huge volume of\\r\\nreserves through open market operations, the discount\\r\\nwindow, and other means to facilitate the functioning of\\r\\nthe financial system. We worked closely with many\\r\\nmarket participants, industry groups, and other\\r\\ngovernment officials on a broad range of financial\\r\\ninfrastructure problems that needed to be resolved\\r\\nquickly and in the common interest.\\nStill, market functioning was impaired for a\\r\\ntime. The substantial damage to trading, settlement,\\r\\nand communications facilities forced many market\\r\\nparticipants to their backup sites. Owing in part to\\r\\ncareful and thorough contingency planning, many firms,\\r\\nmarkets, and exchanges were able to resume business\\r\\nwithin a few hours or days of the attacks. Nonetheless,\\r\\nthe episode did reveal threats to, and vulnerabilities of,\\r\\nthe operations of financial institutions that had not been\\r\\npreviously considered and illustrated the significant\\r\\ninterdependence of the modern financial infrastructure. \\r\\nInstitutions will need to continue to work diligently\\r\\ntoward ensuring that their backup capabilities are\\r\\nadequate. We at the Federal Reserve have been\\r\\nreexamining intensively our own contingency\\r\\ncapabilities to ensure that our central banking functions\\r\\ncan be performed in the most pressing of emergency\\r\\ncircumstances.\\nIn the weeks following the attacks, along with\\r\\nthe drops in activity and confidence, equity prices fell\\r\\nmarkedly, and lenders became more cautious, boosting\\r\\nrisk premiums, especially on credits already considered\\r\\nto be weak. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced\\r\\nshort-term interest rates considerably further. \\r\\nLonger-term yields, including mortgage rates, fell to\\r\\nextraordinarily low levels. The monetary stimulus that\\r\\nwe provided was visible not only in interest rates but\\r\\nalso in a rapid growth of liquidity over the final months\\r\\nof the year, as gauged by the broad monetary\\r\\naggregates. As the fourth quarter progressed, business\\r\\nand consumer confidence recovered, no doubt buoyed\\r\\nby successes in the war on terrorism. The improved\\r\\nsentiment seemed to buffer the decline in economic\\r\\nactivity.\\nIndeed, in the past several months, increasing\\r\\nsigns have emerged that some of the forces that have\\r\\nbeen restraining the economy over the past year are\\r\\nstarting to diminish and that activity is beginning to firm. \\r\\nThe appearance of these signs, in circumstances in\\r\\nwhich the level of the real federal funds rate was at a\\r\\nvery low level, led the Federal Open Market\\r\\nCommittee to keep policy unchanged at its meeting in\\r\\nlate January, although it retained its assessment that the\\r\\nrisks were tilted toward economic weakness.\\n\\n\\nOne key consideration in the assessment that\\r\\nthe economy is close to a turning point is the behavior\\r\\nof inventories. Stocks in many industries have been\\r\\ndrawn down to levels at which firms will soon need to\\r\\ntaper off their rate of liquidation, if they have not\\r\\nalready done so. Any slowing in the rate of inventory\\r\\nliquidation will induce a rise in industrial production if\\r\\ndemand for those products is stable or is falling only\\r\\nmoderately. That rise in production will, other things\\r\\nbeing equal, increase household income and spending. \\r\\nThe runoff of inventories, even apart from the large\\r\\nreduction in motor vehicle stocks, remained sizable in\\r\\nthe fourth quarter. Hence, with production running well\\r\\nbelow sales, the lift to income and spending from the\\r\\ninevitable cessation of inventory liquidation could be\\r\\nsignificant.\\nBut that impetus to the growth of activity will be\\r\\nshort-lived unless sustained increases in final demand\\r\\nkick in before the positive effects of the swing from\\r\\ninventory liquidation dissipate. Most recoveries in the\\r\\npost-World War II period received a boost from a\\r\\nrebound in demand for consumer durables and housing\\r\\nfrom recession-depressed levels in addition to an\\r\\nabatement of inventory liquidation. Through much of\\r\\nlast year's slowdown, however, spending by the\\r\\nhousehold sector held up well and proved to be a\\r\\nmajor stabilizing force. As a consequence, although\\r\\nhousehold spending should continue to trend up, the\\r\\npotential for significant acceleration in activity in this\\r\\nsector is likely to be more limited than in past cycles.\\nIn fact, there are a number of cross currents in\\r\\nthe outlook for household spending. In recent months,\\r\\nlow mortgage interest rates and favorable weather have\\r\\nprovided considerable support to homebuilding. \\r\\nMoreover, attractive mortgage rates have bolstered the\\r\\nsales of existing homes and the extraction of capital\\r\\ngains embedded in home equity that those sales\\r\\nengender. Low rates have also encouraged households\\r\\nto take on larger mortgages when refinancing their\\r\\nhomes. Drawing on home equity in this manner is a\\r\\nsignificant source of funding for consumption and home\\r\\nmodernization. The pace of such extractions likely\\r\\ndropped along with the decline in refinancing activity\\r\\nthat followed the backup in mortgage rates that began\\r\\nin early November. But mortgage rates remain at low\\r\\nlevels and should continue to underpin activity in this\\r\\nsector.\\nConsumer spending received a considerable lift\\r\\nfrom the sales of new motor vehicles, which were\\r\\nremarkably strong in October and November owing to\\r\\nmajor financing incentives. Sales have receded\\r\\nsomewhat as incentives were scaled back, but they\\r\\nhave remained surprisingly resilient. Other consumer\\r\\nspending appears to have advanced at a solid pace in\\r\\nrecent months.\\nThe substantial declines in the prices of natural\\r\\ngas, fuel oil, and gasoline have clearly provided some\\r\\nsupport to real disposable income and spending. To\\r\\nhave a more persistent effect on the ongoing growth of\\r\\ntotal personal consumption expenditures, energy prices\\r\\nwould need to continue declining. Futures prices do\\r\\nnot suggest that such an outcome is in the offing, though\\r\\nthe forecast record of these markets is less than\\r\\nimpressive.\\nChanges in household financial positions in\\r\\nrecent years are probably damping consumer spending,\\r\\nat least to a degree. Overall household wealth relative\\r\\nto income has dropped from a peak multiple of about\\r\\n6.3 at the end of 1999 to around 5.3 currently. \\r\\nMoreover, the aggregate household debt service\\r\\nburden, defined as the ratio of households' required\\r\\ndebt payments to their disposable personal income,\\r\\nrose considerably in recent years, returning last year to\\r\\nits previous cyclical peak of the mid-1980s.\\r\\n\\n\\nHowever, neither wealth nor the burden of debt\\r\\nis distributed evenly across households. Hence, the\\r\\nspending effects of changes in these influences also will\\r\\nnot be evenly distributed. For example, increased debt\\r\\nburdens appear disproportionately attributable to\\r\\nhigher-income households. Calculations by staff at the\\r\\nFederal Reserve suggest that the ratio of household\\r\\nliabilities to annual income for the top fifth of all\\r\\nhouseholds ranked by income, who accounted for 44\\r\\npercent of total after-tax household income last year,\\r\\nrose from about 1.10 at the end of 1998 to 1.20 at the\\r\\nend of the third quarter of 2001. The increase for the\\r\\nlower four-fifths was only about half as large. Although\\r\\nhigh-income households should not experience much\\r\\nstrain in meeting their obligations, others might. Indeed,\\r\\nrepayment difficulties have already increased,\\r\\nparticularly in the subprime markets for consumer loans\\r\\nand mortgages. Delinquency rates may well worsen as\\r\\na delayed result of the strains on household finances\\r\\nover the past two years. Large erosions, however, do\\r\\nnot seem likely, and the overall levels of debt and\\r\\nrepayment delinquencies do not, as of now, appear to\\r\\npose a major impediment to a moderate expansion of\\r\\nconsumption spending going forward. \\nAlthough the macroeconomic effects of debt\\r\\nburdens may be limited, we have already seen\\r\\nsignificant spending restraint among the top fifth of\\r\\nincome earners, presumably owing to the drop in equity\\r\\nprices. The effect of the stock market on other\\r\\nhouseholds' spending has been less evident. \\r\\nModerate-income households have a much larger\\r\\nproportion of their assets in homes, and the continuing\\r\\nrise in the value of houses has provided greater support\\r\\nfor their net worth. Reflecting these differences in\\r\\nportfolio composition, the net worth of the top fifth of\\r\\nincome earners has dropped far more than it did for the\\r\\nbottom 80 percent.\\nAs a consequence, excluding capital gains and\\r\\nlosses from the calculation, as is the convention in our\\r\\nnational income accounts, personal saving for the upper\\r\\nfifth, which had been negative during 1999 and 2000,\\r\\nturned positive in 2001. By contrast, the average\\r\\nsaving rate for the lower four-fifths of households, by\\r\\nincome, was generally positive during the second half of\\r\\nthe 1990s and has fluctuated in a narrow range in the\\r\\npast two years. Accordingly, most of the change in\\r\\nconsumption expenditures that resulted from the bull\\r\\nstock market, and its demise, reflected shifts in\\r\\nspending by upper-income households. The restraining\\r\\neffects from the net decline in wealth during the past\\r\\ntwo years presumably have not, as yet, fully played out\\r\\nand could exert some further damping effect on the\\r\\noverall growth of household spending relative to that of\\r\\nincome.  \\r\\n     \\r\\nPerhaps most central to the outlook for\\r\\nconsumer spending will be developments in the labor\\r\\nmarket. The pace of layoffs quickened last fall,\\r\\nespecially after September 11, and the unemployment\\r\\nrate rose sharply. However, layoffs diminished\\r\\nnoticeably in January, and the reported unemployment\\r\\nrate declined though adjusting for seasonal influences\\r\\nwas difficult last month. Moreover, initial claims for\\r\\nunemployment insurance have decreased markedly, on\\r\\nbalance, providing further evidence of an improvement\\r\\nin labor market conditions. Even if the economy is on\\r\\nthe road to recovery, the unemployment rate, in typical\\r\\ncyclical fashion, may resume its increase for a time, and\\r\\na soft labor market could put something of a damper on\\r\\nconsumer spending.\\nHowever, the extent of such restraint will\\r\\ndepend on how much of any rise in unemployment is\\r\\nthe result of weakened demand for goods and services\\r\\nand how much reflects strengthened productivity. In\\r\\nthe latter case, average real incomes of workers could\\r\\nrise, at least partially offsetting losses of purchasing\\r\\npower that stem from diminished levels of employment. \\r\\nIndeed, preliminary data suggest that productivity has\\r\\nheld up very well of late, and history suggests that any\\r\\ndepressing effect of rapid productivity growth on\\r\\nemployment is only temporary.\\n\\n\\nThe dynamics of inventory investment and the\\r\\nbalance of factors influencing consumer demand will\\r\\nhave important consequences for the economic outlook\\r\\nin coming months. But the broad contours of the\\r\\npresent cycle have been, and will continue to be, driven\\r\\nby the evolution of corporate profits and capital\\r\\ninvestment.\\r\\n     \\r\\nThe retrenchment in capital spending over the\\r\\npast year and a half was central to the sharp slowing\\r\\nwe experienced in overall activity. The steep rise in\\r\\nhigh-tech spending that occurred in the early post-Y2K\\r\\nmonths was clearly not sustainable. The demand for\\r\\nmany of the newer technologies was growing rapidly,\\r\\nbut capacity was expanding even faster, and that\\r\\nimbalance exerted significant downward pressure on\\r\\nprices and the profits of producers of high-tech goods\\r\\nand services. New orders for equipment and software\\r\\nhesitated in the middle of 2000 and then fell abruptly as\\r\\nfirms re-evaluated their capital investment programs. \\r\\nUncertainty about economic prospects boosted risk\\r\\npremiums significantly, and this rise, in turn, propelled\\r\\nrequired, or hurdle, rates of return to markedly elevated\\r\\nlevels. In most cases, businesses required that new\\r\\ninvestments pay off much more rapidly than they had\\r\\npreviously. For much of last year, the resulting decline\\r\\nin investment outlays was fierce and unrelenting. \\r\\nAlthough the weakness was most pronounced in the\\r\\ntechnology area, reductions in capital outlays were\\r\\nbroad-based.\\nThese cutbacks in capital spending interacted\\r\\nwith, and were reinforced by, falling profits and equity\\r\\nprices. Indeed, a striking feature of the current cyclical\\r\\nepisode relative to many earlier ones has been the\\r\\nvirtual absence of pricing power across much of\\r\\nAmerican business, as increasing globalization and\\r\\nderegulation have enhanced competition. In this\\r\\nlow-inflation environment, firms have perceived very\\r\\nlittle ability to pass cost increases on to customers. To\\r\\nbe sure, growth in hourly labor compensation has\\r\\nmoderated in response to slowed inflation and\\r\\ndeteriorating economic conditions. A significant falloff\\r\\nin stock-option realizations and in other forms of\\r\\ncompensation related to company performance has\\r\\nlikely been a factor. But over most of the past year,\\r\\neven those smaller hourly compensation increases\\r\\noutstripped gains in output per hour, on balance,\\r\\nprecipitating a marked decline in profit margins.  \\nBusiness managers, with little opportunity to\\r\\nraise prices, have moved aggressively to stabilize cash\\r\\nflows by trimming workforces. These efforts have\\r\\nlimited any rise in unit costs, attenuated the pressure on\\r\\nprofit margins, and ultimately helped to preserve the\\r\\nvast majority of private-sector jobs. To the extent that\\r\\nbusinesses are successful in stabilizing and eventually\\r\\nboosting profits and cash flow, capital spending should\\r\\nbegin to recover more noticeably.\\nPart of the reduction in pricing power observed\\r\\nin this cycle should be reversed as firming demand\\r\\nenables firms to take back large price discounts. \\r\\nThough such an adjustment would tend to elevate price\\r\\nlevels, underlying inflationary cost pressures should\\r\\nremain contained. To be sure, output per hour is not\\r\\nlikely to accelerate this year as much as in a typical\\r\\nrecovery because businesses have not delayed, as they\\r\\nhave in past recessions, shedding workers at the first\\r\\nindications of weakened demand. But slack in labor\\r\\nmarkets and further increases in productivity should\\r\\nhold labor costs in check and result in rising profit\\r\\nmargins even with inflation remaining low. \\nImproved profit margins and more assured\\r\\nprospects for rising final demand would likely be\\r\\naccompanied by a decline in risk premiums from their\\r\\ncurrent elevated levels toward a more normal range. \\r\\nWith real rates of return on high-tech equipment still\\r\\nattractive, that should provide an additional spur to new\\r\\ninvestment. Reports from businesses around the\\r\\ncountry suggest that the exploitation of available\\r\\nnetworking and other information technologies was only\\r\\npartially completed when the cyclical retrenchment of\\r\\nthe past year began. Many business managers are still\\r\\nof the view, according to a recent survey of purchasing\\r\\nmanagers, that less than half of currently available new,\\r\\nand presumably profitable, supply-chain technologies\\r\\nhave been put into use.\\nRecent evidence suggests that a recovery in at\\r\\nleast some forms of high-tech investment could already\\r\\nbe under way. Production of semiconductors, which in\\r\\nthe past has been a leading indicator of computer\\r\\nproduction, turned up last fall. Expenditures on\\r\\ncomputers rose at a double-digit annual rate in real\\r\\nterms last quarter. But the contraction of investment\\r\\nexpenditures in the communications sector, where the\\r\\namount of overcapacity was substantial, as yet shows\\r\\nfew signs of abating, and business investment in some\\r\\nother sectors, such as aircraft, hit by the drop in air\\r\\ntravel, will presumably remain weak this year.\\nOn balance, the recovery in overall spending on\\r\\nbusiness fixed investment is likely to be only gradual; in\\r\\nparticular, its growth will doubtless be less frenetic than\\r\\nin 1999 and early 2000--a period during which outlays\\r\\nwere boosted by the dislocations of Y2K and the\\r\\nextraordinarily low cost of equity capital available to\\r\\nmany firms. Nonetheless, if the recent more-favorable\\r\\neconomic developments gather momentum,\\r\\nuncertainties will diminish, risk premiums will fall, and\\r\\nthe pace of capital investment embodying new\\r\\ntechnologies will increase.\\nEven a subdued recovery beginning soon would\\r\\nconstitute a truly remarkable performance for the\\r\\nAmerican economy in the face of so severe a decline in\\r\\nequity asset values and an unprecedented blow from\\r\\nterrorists to the foundations of our market systems. \\r\\nFor, if the tentative indications that the contraction\\r\\nphase of this business cycle is drawing to a close are\\r\\nultimately confirmed, we will have experienced a\\r\\nsignificantly milder downturn than the long history of\\r\\nbusiness cycles would have led us to expect. Crucially,\\r\\nthe imbalances that triggered the downturn and that\\r\\ncould have prolonged this difficult period did not fester. \\r\\nThe obvious questions are what has changed in our\\r\\neconomy in recent decades to provide such resilience\\r\\nand whether such changes will persist into the future.\\nDoubtless, the substantial improvement in the\\r\\naccess of business decisionmakers to real-time\\r\\ninformation has played a key role. Thirty years ago, the\\r\\ntimeliness of available information varied across\\r\\ncompanies and industries, often resulting in differences\\r\\nin the speed and magnitude of their responses to\\r\\nchanging business conditions. In contrast to the\\r\\nsituation that prevails today, businesses did not have\\r\\nreal-time data systems that enabled decisionmakers in\\r\\ndifferent enterprises to work from essentially the same\\r\\nset of information. In those earlier years, imbalances\\r\\nwere inadvertently allowed to build to such an extent\\r\\nthat their inevitable correction engendered significant\\r\\neconomic stress. That process of correction and the\\r\\naccompanying economic and financial disruptions too\\r\\noften led to deep and prolonged recessions. Today,\\r\\nbusinesses have large quantities of data available\\r\\nvirtually in real time. As a consequence, they address\\r\\nand resolve economic imbalances far more rapidly than\\r\\nin the past.\\n\\n\\nThe apparent increased flexibility of the American\\r\\neconomy arguably also reflects the extent of\\r\\nderegulation over the past quarter century. Certainly, if\\r\\nthe energy sector were still in the tight regulatory fetters\\r\\nof the 1970s, our flexibility today would be markedly\\r\\nless. That the collapse of Enron barely registered in the\\r\\nrelatively recently developed markets for natural gas\\r\\nand electric power was encouraging. Although the\\r\\nterrorist attacks hit air travel especially hard over the\\r\\npast few months, deregulation of that industry has\\r\\ndemonstrably increased the quantity and flexibility, if\\r\\nnot the profitability, of air travel over the past twenty\\r\\nyears. Trucking and rail deregulation has added\\r\\nflexibility to the movement of\", \"innovation in the financial\\r\\nsector have been especially important in enhancing\\r\\noverall economic resilience. New financial\\r\\nproducts--including derivatives, asset-backed\\r\\nsecurities, collateralized loan obligations, and\\r\\ncollateralized mortgage obligations, among\\r\\nothers--have enabled risk to be dispersed more\\r\\neffectively to those willing to, and presumably capable\\r\\nof, bearing it. Shocks to the overall economic system\\r\\nare accordingly less likely to create cascading credit\\r\\nfailure. Lenders have the opportunity to be\\r\\nconsiderably more diversified, and borrowers are far\\r\\nless dependent on specific institutions for funds. \\r\\nFinancial derivatives, particularly, have grown at a\\r\\nphenomenal pace over the past fifteen years, evidently\\r\\nfulfilling a need to hedge risks that were not readily\\r\\ndeflected in earlier decades. Despite the concerns that\\r\\nthese complex instruments have induced (an issue I will\\r\\naddress shortly), the record of their performance,\\r\\nespecially over the past couple of stressful years,\\r\\nsuggests that on balance they have contributed to the\\r\\ndevelopment of a far more flexible and efficient financial\\r\\nsystem--both domestically and internationally--than\\r\\nwe had just twenty or thirty years ago.\\nAs a consequence of increased access to real-time\\r\\ninformation and, more arguably, extensive\\r\\nderegulation in financial and product markets and the\\r\\nunbundling of risk, imbalances are more likely to be\\r\\nreadily contained, and cyclical episodes overall should\\r\\nbe less severe than would be the case otherwise. If this\\r\\nis indeed the case--and it must be considered\\r\\nspeculative until more evidence is gathered--the\\r\\nimplied reduction in volatility, other things equal, would\\r\\nlower risk and equity premiums.\\nOther things, however, may not be wholly equal. \\r\\nThe very technologies that appear to be the\\r\\nmain cause of our apparent increased flexibility and\\r\\nresiliency may also be imparting different forms of\\r\\nvulnerability that could intensify or be intensified by a\\r\\nbusiness cycle.\\nFrom one perspective, the ever-increasing\\r\\nproportion of our GDP that represents conceptual as\\r\\ndistinct from physical value added may actually have\\r\\nlessened cyclical volatility. In particular, the fact that\\r\\nconcepts cannot be held as inventories means a greater\\r\\nshare of GDP is not subject to a type of dynamics that\\r\\namplifies cyclical swings. But an economy in which\\r\\nconcepts form an important share of valuation has its\\r\\nown vulnerabilities.\\nAs the recent events surrounding Enron have\\r\\nhighlighted, a firm is inherently fragile if its value added\\r\\nemanates more from conceptual as distinct from\\r\\nphysical assets. A physical asset, whether an office\\r\\nbuilding or an automotive assembly plant, has the\\r\\ncapability of producing goods even if the reputation of\\r\\nthe managers of such facilities falls under a cloud. The\\r\\nrapidity of Enron's decline is an effective illustration of\\r\\nthe vulnerability of a firm whose market value largely\\r\\nrests on capitalized reputation. The physical assets of\\r\\nsuch a firm comprise a small proportion of its asset\\r\\nbase. Trust and reputation can vanish overnight. A\\r\\nfactory cannot.\\nThe implications of such a loss of confidence\\r\\nfor the macroeconomy depend importantly on how\\r\\nfreely the conceptual capital of the fading firm can be\\r\\nreplaced by a competitor or a new entrant into the\\r\\nindustry. Even if entry is relatively free,\\r\\nmacroeconomic risks can emerge if problems at one\\r\\nparticular firm tend to make investors and\\r\\ncounterparties uncertain about other firms that they see\\r\\nas potentially similarly situated. The difficulty of valuing\\r\\nfirms that deal primarily with concepts and the growing\\r\\nsize and importance of these firms may make our\\r\\neconomy more susceptible to this type of contagion.\\nAnother, more conventional determinant of\\r\\nstability will be the economy's degree of leverage--the\\r\\nextent to which debt rather than equity is financing the\\r\\nlevel of capital. The proper degree of leverage in a\\r\\nfirm, or in an economy as a whole, is an inherently\\r\\nelusive figure that almost certainly changes from time to\\r\\ntime. Clearly, firms find some leverage advantageous in\\r\\nenhancing returns on equity, and thus moderate\\r\\nleverage undoubtedly boosts the capital stock and the\\r\\nlevel of output. A sophisticated financial system, with\\r\\nits substantial array of instruments to unbundle risks,\\r\\nwill tend toward a higher degree of leverage at any\\r\\ngiven level of underlying economic risk. But, the\\r\\ngreater the degree of leverage in any economy, the\\r\\ngreater its vulnerability to unexpected shortfalls in\\r\\ndemand and mistakes.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, on a historical cost basis, the ratio of\\r\\ndebt to net worth for the nonfinancial corporate\\r\\nbusiness sector did rise, from 71 percent at the end of\\r\\n1997 to about 81 percent at the end of the third quarter\\r\\nof last year, though it is still well below its level at the\\r\\nbeginning of the recession in 1990. The ratio of interest\\r\\npayments to cash flow, one indicator of the\\r\\nconsequence of leverage, has crept up in recent years,\\r\\nreflecting growth in debt. However, owing to lower\\r\\ninterest rates, it remains far below its levels of the early\\r\\n1990s.\\nAlthough the fears of business leverage have been\\r\\nmostly confined to specific sectors in recent years,\\r\\nconcerns over potential systemic problems resulting\\r\\nfrom the vast expansion of derivatives have reemerged\\r\\nwith the difficulties of Enron. To be sure, firms like\\r\\nEnron, and Long-Term Capital Management before it,\\r\\nwere major players in the derivatives markets. But\\r\\ntheir problems were readily traceable to an old\\r\\nfashioned excess of debt, however acquired, as well as\\r\\nto opaque accounting of that leverage and lax\\r\\ncounterparty scrutiny. Swaps and other derivatives\\r\\nthroughout their short history, including over the past\\r\\neighteen months, have been remarkably free of default. \\r\\nOf course, there can be latent problems in any market\\r\\nthat expands as rapidly as these markets have. \\r\\nRegulators and supervisors are particularly sensitive to\\r\\nthis possibility. Derivatives have provided greater\\r\\nflexibility to our financial system. But their very\\r\\ncomplexity could leave counterparties vulnerable to\\r\\nsignificant risk that they do not currently recognize, and\\r\\nhence these instruments potentially expose the overall\\r\\nsystem if mistakes are large. In that regard, the\\r\\nmarket's reaction to the revelations about Enron\\r\\nprovides encouragement that the force of market\\r\\ndiscipline can be counted on over time to foster much\\r\\ngreater transparency and increased clarity and\\r\\ncompleteness in the accounting treatment of derivatives.\\nHow these countervailing forces for stability\\r\\nevolve will surely be a major determinant of the\\r\\nvolatility that our economy will experience in the years\\r\\nahead. Monetary policy will have to be particularly\\r\\nsensitive to the possibility that the resiliency our\\r\\neconomy has exhibited during the past two years\\r\\nsignals subtle changes in the way our system functions.  \\nOur most recent experiences underscore this\\r\\npossibility, along with the persistence of a long list of\\r\\nolder, well-tested, economic verities. Inventories,\\r\\nespecially among producers and purchasers of\\r\\nhigh-tech products, did run to excess over the past\\r\\nyear, as sales forecasts went badly astray; alas,\\r\\ntechnology has not allowed us to see into the future any\\r\\nmore clearly than we could previously. But technology\\r\\ndid facilitate the quick recognition of the weakening in\\r\\nsales and backup of inventories. This enabled\\r\\nproducers to respond forcefully, as evidenced by\\r\\noutput adjustments that have resulted in the\\r\\nextraordinary rate of inventory liquidation we\\r\\nexperienced late last year.\\nFor the period just ahead, the central tendency\\r\\nof the forecasts of the members of the Federal Open\\r\\nMarket Committee is for real GDP to rise 2-1/2 to\\r\\n3 percent during 2002. Such a pace for the growth of\\r\\nreal output is somewhat below the rates of growth\\r\\ntypically seen early in previous expansions. Certain\\r\\nfactors, such as the lack of pent-up demand in the\\r\\nconsumer sector, significant levels of excess capacity in\\r\\na number of industries, weakness and financial fragility\\r\\nin some key international trading partners, and\\r\\npersistent caution in financial markets at home, seem\\r\\nlikely to restrain the near-term performance of the\\r\\neconomy.\\nIn line with past experience during the early\\r\\nstages of expansion, labor market performance is\\r\\nexpected initially to lag as firms rely primarily on\\r\\novertime and shifts from part-time to full-time work. \\r\\nThe unemployment rate is anticipated to rise somewhat\\r\\nfurther over 2002, to the area of 6 to 6-1/4 percent. \\r\\nFOMC members evidently anticipate that slack in\\r\\nresource utilization, the lagged effects of past declines in\\r\\nenergy prices, and productivity growth will keep\\r\\ninflation low this year, with the price index for personal\\r\\nconsumption expenditure increasing about 1-1/2\\r\\npercent.  \\nDespite its forecast that economic growth is likely\\r\\nto resume at a moderate pace, as I already noted,\\r\\nthe Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting on\\r\\nJanuary 30 saw the risks nonetheless as continuing to\\r\\nbe weighted mainly toward conditions that may\\r\\ngenerate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. \\r\\nIn effect, the FOMC indicated that until the dynamics\\r\\nof sustained expansion are more firmly in place, it\\r\\nremained concerned about the possibility of weak\\r\\ngrowth for a time, despite the very low level of the\\r\\nfederal funds rate.\\nAlthough there are ample reasons to be cautious\\r\\nabout the economic outlook, the recuperative\\r\\npowers of the U.S. economy, as I have tried to\\r\\nemphasize in my presentation, have been remarkable. \\r\\nWhen I presented our report on monetary policy to this\\r\\nCommittee last summer, few if any of us could have\\r\\nanticipated events such as those to which our nation has\\r\\nsubsequently been subjected. The economic\\r\\nconsequences of those events and their aftermath are\\r\\nan integral part of the many challenges that we now\\r\\ncollectively face. The U.S. economy has experienced a\\r\\nsubstantial shock, and, no doubt, we continue to face\\r\\nrisks in the period ahead. But the response thus far of\\r\\nour citizens to these new economic challenges provides\"]\n"

      "['one-half months since I last testified before this Committee on monetary policy, the economy has continued to expand, largely along the broad contours we had anticipated at that time.  Although the uncertainties of earlier this year are as yet not fully resolved, the U.S. economy appears to have withstood a set of blows--major declines in equity markets, a sharp retrenchment in investment spending, and the tragic terrorist attacks of last September--that in previous business cycles almost surely would have induced a severe contraction.  The mildness and brevity of the downturn, as I indicated earlier this year, are a testament to the notable improvement in the resilience and flexibility of the U.S. economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while the economy has held up remarkably well, not surprisingly the depressing effects of recent events linger.  Spending will continue to adjust for some time to the declines that have occurred in equity prices.  In recent weeks, those prices have fallen further on net, in part under the influence of growing concerns about corporate governance and business transparency problems that evidently accumulated during the earlier rapid runup in these markets.  Considerable uncertainties--about the progress of the adjustment of capital spending and the rebound in profitability, about the potential for additional revelations of corporate malfeasance, and about possible risks from global political events and terrorism--still confront us. \\r\\n \\r\\nNevertheless, the fundamentals are in place for a return to sustained healthy growth:  Imbalances in inventories and capital goods appear largely to have been worked off; inflation is quite low and is expected to remain so; and productivity growth has been remarkably strong, implying considerable underlying support to household and business spending as well as potential relief from cost and price pressures.  In considering policy actions this year, the Federal Open Market Committee has recognized that the accommodative stance of policy adopted last year in response to the substantial forces restraining the economy likely will not prove compatible over time with maximum sustainable growth and price stability.  But, with inflation currently contained and with few signs that upward pressures are likely to develop any time soon, we have chosen to maintain that stance pending evidence that the forces inhibiting economic growth are dissipating enough to allow the strong fundamentals to show through more fully. \\r\\n\\r\\n As has often been the case in the past, the behavior of inventories provided substantial impetus for the initial strengthening of the economy.  Manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers took vigorous steps throughout 2001 to eliminate an unwanted buildup of stocks that emerged when final demand slowed late in 2000.  By early this year, with inventory levels having apparently come into better alignment with expected sales, the pace of inventory reduction began to ebb, and efforts to limit further drawdowns provided a considerable boost to production.  The available evidence suggests that, in some sectors, liquidation may be giving way to a rebuilding of inventories.  However, as inventories start to grow more in line with sales in coming quarters, the contribution of inventory investment to real GDP growth should lessen.  As a result, the strength of final demand will play its usual central role in determining the vigor of the expansion. While final demand has been increasing, the pace of forward momentum remains uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHousehold spending held up quite well during the downturn and through recent months, and thus served as an important stabilizing force for the overall economy.  Real consumer outlays and spending on residential construction each rose about 3 percent over the course of 2001, even as the growth of real GDP fell off to only ï¿½ percent.  Household spending was boosted by ongoing increases in incomes, which in turn were spurred by strong advances in productivity as well as by legislated tax reductions and, in recent months, by extended unemployment insurance benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonetary policy also played a role by cutting short-term interest rates, which helped lower household borrowing costs.  Particularly important in buoying spending were the very low levels of mortgage interest rates, which encouraged households to purchase homes, refinance debt and lower debt service burdens, and extract equity from homes to finance expenditures.  Fixed mortgage rates remain at historically low levels and thus should continue to fuel reasonably strong housing demand and, through equity extraction, to support consumer spending as well.  Indeed, recent sizable increases in home prices, which reflect the effects on demand of low mortgage rates, immigration, and shortages of buildable land in some areas, have significantly increased the equity in houses that homeowners can readily tap through home equity loans and mortgage refinancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut those sources of strength probably will be tempered by other influences.  As we noted in February, because consumer and residential expenditures did not decline during the overall downturn, there is little pent-up demand to be satisfied.  Consequently, a surge in household spending early in this recovery is unlikely.  Moreover, the declines in household wealth that have occurred over the past couple of years should continue to restrain spending in the period ahead.  Still, despite concerns about economic prospects, equity valuations, terrorism, and geopolitical conflicts, consumers do not appear to have retrenched in retail markets.  Indeed, consumers responded strongly to the new interest rate incentives of motor vehicle manufacturers this month.  Early reports indicate a significant improvement in sales over June.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nBy contrast, business spending has been depressed.  The recent economic downturn was driven, in large measure, by the sharp falloff in the demand for capital goods that occurred when firms suddenly realized that stocks of such goods--both those already in place as well as those in inventory--were excessive.  The resulting declines in the production of capital goods were particularly sizable in the high-tech sector.  Monthly shipments of computers and peripherals, for example, fell by about 40 percent from their peak in 1999 through their trough in 2001.  Sales by communications equipment producers slumped just as sharply.  Outside the high-tech sector, production also declined.  Assemblies of commercial aircraft slowed abruptly.  In addition, the construction of office and industrial buildings fell off noticeably.  The collapse of many Internet firms and the difficulties of the high-tech sector more generally led to a significant drop in the demand for office space that was exacerbated as the economic slowdown widened beyond the tech sector.  Overall, the level of real business fixed investment plunged about 11 percent between its quarterly peak in the final months of 2000 and the first quarter of this year.  \\r\\n \\r\\nWith the adjustment of the capital stock to desired levels now evidently well advanced, business fixed investment may be set to improve.  A recovery in this category of spending is likely to be gradual by historical standards and uneven across sectors.  For example, an upturn in production of semiconductors and computers has been under way now for nearly a year, but with significant overcapacity still prevailing in some segments of the telecom industry, investment in communications equipment is likely to remain subdued for some time to come.  Overall capital expenditures should strengthen with time.  In particular, firms should respond increasingly to the expected improvement in the outlook for sales and profits, low debt financing costs, the heightened incentives resulting from the partial expensing tax provisions legislated earlier this year, and especially the productivity enhancements offered by continuing advances in technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, despite the recent depressed level of investment expenditures, the productivity of the U.S. economy has continued to rise at a remarkably strong pace.  In the nonfarm business sector, output per hour is currently estimated to have soared at an average annual rate of about 7 percent over the fourth quarter of 2001 and first quarter of 2002, and the available evidence points to continued gains last quarter--though not at the frenetic pace of the preceding half year.  In part, these increases in productivity reflect the very cautious attitudes of managers toward hiring.  But the magnitude of the recent gains would not have been possible without ongoing benefits from the rapid pace of technological advance and from the heavy investment over the latter half of the 1990s in capital equipment incorporating such advances.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these encouraging developments regarding the longer-term prospects for the economy, financial markets have been notably skittish of late, and business managers remain decidedly cautious.  In part, these attitudes reflect the lingering effects of the shocks that our economy endured in 2000 and 2001.  Particularly given the dimensions of those shocks, some persistent uncertainty and concern are not surprising.\\r\\n \\r\\nAlso contributing to the dispirited attitudes among many corporate executives is the intensely competitive business environment facing their firms.  Increased competition, while producing manifold benefits for consumers and for the economy as a whole, clearly makes individual firms\\' operations more difficult.  Past deregulation and, more recently, the enhanced speed and efficiency of information flows resulting from technological advances are strengthening competition domestically.  In addition, globalization is intensifying competition in a broad range of markets and damping pricing power across developed and developing nations alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose businesses where heightened competition has engendered a loss of pricing power have sought ways to raise profit margins by employing technology to lower costs and improve efficiency.  In the United States, as a consequence of the interaction of monetary policy, globalization, and cost-reducing productivity advances, price inflation has fallen in recent years to its lowest level in four decades, as has the recent growth rate of nominal GDP and consolidated corporate revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn part because nominal corporate revenues, although no longer declining, are growing only tepidly, managers seem to remain skeptical of the evidence of an emerging upturn.  Profit margins do appear to be coming off their lows registered late last year, but, unsurprisingly, the recovery in economic activity from a shallow decline appears less vigorous than in the past.  The lowest sustained rates of inflation in forty years imply that nominal growth in sales and profits looks particularly anemic.  In contrast, in the 1950s and early 1960s, the last period of stable prices, populations and employment were growing considerably faster than the recent pace so that growth in nominal GDP, consolidated corporate sales, and profits was seen as still quite respectable.  Reflecting concerns about the strength of the recovery, managers continue to limit capital spending to only the most pressing needs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nGiven the key role of perceptions of subdued profitability in the current period, it is ironic that the practice of not expensing stock-option grants, which contributed to the surge in earnings reported to shareholders from 1997 to 2000, has imparted a deceptive weakness to the growth of earnings reported to shareholders in recent quarters.  As stock market gains turned to losses a couple of years ago, the willingness of employees to accept stock options in lieu of cash or other forms of compensation apparently diminished.  According to estimates by Federal Reserve staff, the value of stock option grants for the S&P 500 corporations fell about 15 percent from 2000 to 2001, and grant values have likely declined still further this year.  Moreover, options grants are presumably being replaced over time by cash or other forms of compensation, which are expensed, contributing further to less robust growth in earnings reported to shareholders from its trough last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, the measure of profits calculated by the Department of Commerce for the National Income and Product Accounts is designed to gauge the economic profitability of current operations.  It excludes a number of one-time charges that appear in shareholder reports, and, importantly, records options as an expense, albeit at the time of exercise.  Although this treatment of the cost of options is not ideal, it is arguably superior to their treatment in shareholder reports, where options are generally not expensed at all.  NIPA profits closely approximate those obtained from reports submitted for tax purposes, and, for obvious reasons, corporations tend not to inflate taxable earnings.  Consequently, NIPA profits have been far less subject to the spin evident in reports to shareholders in recent years.  NIPA profits have increased sharply since the third quarter of last year, partly reflecting the dramatic jump in productivity and decline in unit labor costs.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe difficulties of judging earnings trends have been intensified by revelations of misleading accounting practices at some prominent businesses.  The resulting investor skepticism about earnings reports has not only depressed the valuation of equity shares, but it also has been reportedly a factor in the rising risk spreads on corporate debt issued by the lower rung of investment-grade and below-investment grade firms, further elevating the cost of capital for these borrowers.   Businesses concerned about the impact of possible adverse publicity regarding their accounting practices on their access to finance could revert to a much heavier emphasis on cash generation and accumulation.  Such an emphasis could slow new capital investment initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent impressive advances in productivity suggest that to date any impairment of efficiency of U. S. corporations overall has been small.  Efficiency is of course a key measure of corporate governance.  Nonetheless, the danger that breakdowns in governance could at some point significantly erode business efficiency remains worrisome.  Well-functioning markets require accurate information to allocate capital and other resources, and market participants must have confidence that our predominately voluntary system of exchange is transparent and fair.   Although business transactions are governed by laws and contracts, if even a modest fraction of those transactions had to be adjudicated, our courts would be swamped into immobility.  Thus, our market system depends critically on trust--trust in the word of our colleagues and trust in the word of those with whom we do business.  Falsification and fraud are highly destructive to free-market capitalism and, more broadly, to the underpinnings of our society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, shareholders and potential investors would have been protected from widespread misinformation if any one of the many bulwarks safeguarding appropriate corporate evaluation had held.  In too many cases, none did.  Lawyers, internal and external auditors, corporate boards, Wall Street security analysts, rating agencies, and large institutional holders of stock all failed for one reason or another to detect and blow the whistle on those who breached the level of trust essential to well-functioning markets.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy did corporate governance checks and balances that served us reasonably well in the past break down?  At root was the rapid enlargement of stock market capitalizations in the latter part of the 1990s that arguably engendered an outsized increase in opportunities for avarice.  An infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business community.  Our historical guardians of financial information were overwhelmed.  Too many corporate executives sought ways to \"harvest\" some of those stock market gains.  As a result, the highly desirable spread of shareholding and options among business managers perversely created incentives to artificially inflate reported earnings in order to keep stock prices high and rising.  This outcome suggests that the options were poorly structured, and, consequently, they failed to properly align the long-term interests of shareholders and managers, the paradigm so essential for effective corporate governance.  The incentives they created overcame the good judgment of too many corporate managers.  It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past.  It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the recent breakdown of protective barriers resulted from a once-in-a-generation frenzy of speculation that is now over.  With profitable opportunities for malfeasance markedly diminished, far fewer questionable practices are likely to be initiated in the immediate future.  To be sure, previously undiscovered misdeeds will no doubt continue to surface in the weeks ahead as chastened CEOs restate earnings.  But even if the worst is over, history cautions us that memories fade.  Thus, it is incumbent upon us to apply the lessons of this recent period to inhibit any recurrence in the future.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nA major focus of reform of corporate governance, of course, should be an improved functioning of our economy.  A related, but separate, issue is that shareholders must perceive that corporate governance is properly structured so that financial gains are fairly negotiated between existing shareholders and corporate officeholders.  Shareholding is now predominately for investment, not corporate control.  Our vast and highly liquid financial markets enable large institutional shareholders to sell their shares when they perceive inadequacies of corporate governance, rather than fix them.  This has placed de facto control in the hands of the chief executive officer.  Shareholders routinely authorize slates of directors recommended by the CEO.  Generally, problems need to become quite large before CEOs are dislodged by dissenting shareholders or hostile takeovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nManifestations of lax corporate governance, in my judgment, are largely a symptom of a failed CEO.  Having independent directors, whose votes are not controlled by the CEO, is essential, of course, for any effective board of directors.  However, we need to be careful that in the process, we do not create a competing set of directors and conflicting sources of power that are likely to impair a corporation\\'s effectiveness.  The functioning of any business requires a central point of authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, a CEO must be afforded full authority to implement corporate strategies, but also must bear the responsibility to accurately report the resulting condition of the corporation to shareholders and potential investors.  Unless such responsibilities are enforced with very stiff penalties for non-compliance, as many now recommend, our accounting systems and other elements of corporate governance will function in a less than optimum manner.\\r\\n \\r\\nAlready existing statutes, of course, prohibit corporate fraud and misrepresentation.  But even a small increase in the likelihood of large, possibly criminal penalties for egregious behavior of CEOs can have profoundly important effects on all aspects of corporate governance because the fulcrum of governance is the chief executive officer.  If a CEO countenances managing reported earnings, that attitude will drive the entire accounting regime of the firm.  If he or she instead insists on an objective representation of a company\\'s business dealings, that standard will govern recordkeeping and due diligence.  It has been my experience on numerous corporate boards that CEOs who insist that their auditors render objective accounts get them.  And CEOs who discourage corner-cutting by subordinates are rarely exposed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognize that I am saying that the state of corporate governance to a very large extent reflects the character of the CEO, and that this is a very difficult issue to address.  Although we may not be able to change the character of corporate officers, we can change behavior through incentives and penalties.  That, in my judgment, could dramatically improve the state of corporate governance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur most recent experiences clearly indicate, however, that adjustments to the existing structure of regulation of corporate governance and accounting beyond addressing the role of the CEO are needed.  In designing changes to our regulatory framework, we should keep in mind that regulation and supervision of our financial markets need to be flexible enough to adapt to an ever-changing and evolving financial structure.  Regulation cannot be static or it will soon distort the efficient flow of capital from savers to those who invest in plant and equipment.  There will be certain areas where Congress will choose to provide a specific statutory direction that will be as applicable thirty years from now as today.  In other cases, agency rule-making flexibility under new or existing statutes is more appropriate.  Finally, there are some areas where private supervision would be most effective, such as that of the New York Stock Exchange, which requires certain standards of governance for listing.\\r\\n \\r\\nAbove all, we must bear in mind that the critical issue should be how to strengthen the legal base of free market capitalism:  the property rights of shareholders and other owners of capital.  Fraud and deception are thefts of property.  In my judgment, more generally, unless the laws governing how markets and corporations function are perceived as fair, our economic system cannot', \"of market commentary in recent weeks has suggested that concerns about earnings prospects and the proliferating revelations of serious governance and accounting issues have contributed not only to lower equity prices but also to a decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  And some of that commentary has extrapolated the trend of dollar weakness.  As you know, the Secretary of the Treasury speaks for our government on exchange rate policy.  But, given the recent intense interest in the future course of the dollar, I would like to raise a technical issue and a flag of caution regarding those forecasts--or, for that matter, any forecast of exchange rates.  There may be more forecasting of exchange rates, with less success, than almost any other economic variable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason that it is so difficult is that an exchange rate is a very complex price that balances, on the one hand, the demand for, for example, dollars stemming from the demand for dollar investments and for U.S. exports against, on the other hand, the demand for foreign currencies by U.S. investors desiring to acquire foreign assets and by U.S. importers of foreign goods and services.  Hence, exchange-rate movements depend on shifting perceptions of the relative returns from investing in different countries and on the myriad influences on relative tendencies to import and export.  The net effect of these factors over any future time period is extraordinarily difficult to assess in advance.  Although measures such as real interest rate differentials, differential rates of productivity gains, and chronic external deficits are often employed to explain exchange rate behavior, none has been found to be consistently useful in forecasting exchange rates even over substantial periods of one or two years.\\r\\n \\r\\nOur ability to attract foreign capital in coming years will help facilitate the increases in investment that will promote continued gains in productivity and standards of living.  But policymakers should also recognize the important role that prudent fiscal policy can play in promoting national saving and maintaining conditions conducive to investment and continued strong growth of productivity.  Beginning in the late 1980s, impressive progress was made in reining in federal expenditures and restoring a better balance between spending and revenues.   The lower federal deficits and, for a time, the realization of surpluses contributed significantly to improved national saving and thereby put downward pressure on real interest rates.  This, in turn, enhanced the incentives of businesses to invest in productive plant and equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, however, some of those gains have been given up.  To a degree, the return to budget deficits has been a result of temporary factors, especially the falloff in revenues and the increase in outlays associated with the economic downturn.  Those influences should tend to reverse over the next year or two, other things equal, although the decline in revenues reflecting the drop in capital gains realizations, including those on options, is unlikely to be fully reversed.  And the necessary rise in expenditures related to the war on terrorism and enhanced homeland security has also played a role, as have the tax reductions legislated last year.  Unfortunately, there are also signs that the underlying disciplinary mechanisms that formed the framework for federal budget decisions over most of the past fifteen years have eroded.  The Administration and the Congress can make a valuable contribution to the prospects for the growth of the economy by taking measures to restore this discipline and return the federal budget over time to a posture that is supportive of long-term economic growth.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo sum up, the U.S. economy has confronted very significant challenges over the past year or so.  Those problems, however, led to only a relatively brief and mild downturn in economic activity, reflecting the underlying strength and increased resiliency that the economy has achieved in recent years.  The effects of the recent difficulties will linger for a bit longer but, as they wear off, and absent significant further adverse shocks, the U.S. economy is poised to resume a pattern of sustainable growth.  Indeed, the central tendency of Federal Reserve policymakers' forecasts is for expansion of real GDP over the four quarters of 2002 of 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent, somewhat above the rates anticipated in our February report.  Economic growth is projected to be solid again next year, with real output rising 3-1/2 to 4 percent.  Monetary policymakers anticipate that these gains should be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent by the end of next year.  Inflation is expected to be subdued throughout, with prices for personal consumption expenditures increasing at only a 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent rate.  Our prospects for extending this performance over time can be enhanced through implementation of sound monetary, financial, fiscal\"]\n"

      "[\"has been extraordinary for the American economy and monetary policy.  The synergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the underlying growth rate of productivity.  The capitalization of those higher expected returns boosted equity prices, contributing to a substantial pickup in household spending on new homes, durable goods, and other types of consumption generally, beyond even that implied by the enhanced rise in real incomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhen I last reported to you in July, economic growth was just exhibiting initial signs of slowing from what had been an exceptionally rapid and unsustainable rate of increase that began a year earlier. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe surge in spending had lifted the growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goods and business capital equipment to rates that could not be continued.  The elevated level of light vehicle sales, for example, implied a rate of increase in the number of vehicles on the road hardly sustainable for a mature industry.  And even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on even faster.  Overall, capacity in high-tech manufacturing industries rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in excess of its rapid rate of increase over the previous three years.  Hence, a temporary glut in these industries and falling prospective rates of return were inevitable at some point.  Clearly, some slowing in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the economy was to progress along a balanced and sustainable growth path.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut the adjustment has occurred much faster than most businesses anticipated, with the process likely intensified by the rise in the cost of energy that has drained business and household purchasing power.  Purchases of durable goods and investment in capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter.  Because the extent of the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses, it induced some backup in inventories, despite the more advanced just-in-time technologies that have in recent years enabled firms to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in demand.  Inventory-sales ratios rose only moderately; but relative to the levels of these ratios implied by their downtrend over the past decade, the emerging imbalances appeared considerably larger.  Reflecting these growing imbalances, manufacturing purchasing managers reported last month that inventories in the hands of their customers had risen to excessively high levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a result, a round of inventory rebalancing appears to be in progress.  Accordingly, the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of 2000 intensified, perhaps even to the point of growth stalling out around the turn of the year.  As the economy slowed, equity prices fell, especially in the high-tech sector, where previous high valuations and optimistic forecasts were being reevaluated, resulting in significant losses for some investors.  In addition, lenders turned more cautious.  This tightening of financial conditions, itself, contributed to restraint on spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\tAgainst this background, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) undertook a series of aggressive monetary policy steps.  At its December meeting, the FOMC shifted its announced assessment of the balance of risks to express concern about economic weakness, which encouraged declines in market interest rates.  Then on January 3, and again on January 31, the FOMC reduced its targeted federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point, to its current level of 5-1/2 percent.  An essential precondition for this type of response was that underlying cost and price pressures remained subdued, so that our front-loaded actions were unlikely to jeopardize the stable, low inflation environment necessary to foster investment and advances in productivity.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith signs of softness still patently in evidence at the time of its January meeting, the FOMC retained its sense that downside risks predominate.  The exceptional degree of slowing so evident toward the end of last year (perhaps in part the consequence of adverse weather) seemed less evident in January and February.  Nonetheless, the economy appears to be on a track well below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential and, even after the policy actions we took in January, the risks continue skewed toward the economy's remaining on a path inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCrucial to the assessment of the outlook and the understanding of recent policy actions is the role of technological change and productivity in shaping near-term cyclical forces as well as long-term sustainable growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe prospects for sustaining strong advances in productivity in the years ahead remain favorable.  As one would expect, productivity growth has slowed along with the economy.  But what is notable is that, during the second half of 2000, output per hour advanced at a pace sufficiently impressive to provide strong support for the view that the rate of growth of structural productivity remains well above its pace of a decade ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, although recent short-term business profits have softened considerably, most corporate managers appear not to have altered to any appreciable extent their long-standing optimism about the future returns from using new technology.  A recent survey of purchasing managers suggests that the wave of new on-line business-to-business activities is far from cresting.  Corporate managers more generally, rightly or wrongly, appear to remain remarkably sanguine about the potential for innovations to continue to enhance productivity and profits.  At least this is what is gleaned from the projections of equity analysts, who, one must presume, obtain most of their insights from corporate managers.  According to one prominent survey, the three- to five-year average earnings projections of more than a thousand analysts, though exhibiting some signs of diminishing in recent months, have generally held at a very high level.  Such expectations, should they persist, bode well for continued strength in capital accumulation and sustained elevated growth of structural productivity over the longer term.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe same forces that have been boosting growth in structural productivity seem also to have accelerated the process of cyclical adjustment.  Extraordinary improvements in business-to-business communication have held unit costs in check, in part by greatly speeding up the flow of information.  New technologies for supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing imply that businesses can perceive imbalances in inventories at a very early stage--virtually in real time--and can cut production promptly in response to the developing signs of unintended inventory building.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOur most recent experience with some inventory backup, of course, suggests that surprises can still occur and that this process is still evolving.  Nonetheless, compared with the past, much progress is evident.  A couple of decades ago, inventory data would not have been available to most firms until weeks had elapsed, delaying a response and, hence, eventually requiring even deeper cuts in production.  In addition, the foreshortening of lead times on delivery of capital equipment, a result of information and other newer technologies, has engendered a more rapid adjustment of capital goods production to shifts in demand that result\\r\\nfrom changes in firms' expectations of sales and profitability.  A decade ago, extended backlogs on capital equipment meant a more stretched-out process of production adjustments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEven consumer spending decisions have become increasingly responsive to changes in the perceived profitability of firms through their effects on the value of households' holdings of equities.  Stock market wealth has risen substantially relative to income in recent years--itself a reflection of the extraordinary surge of innovation.  As a consequence, changes in stock market wealth have become a more important determinant of shifts in consumer spending relative to changes in current household income than was the case just five to seven years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe hastening of the adjustment to emerging imbalances is generally beneficial.  It means that those imbalances are not allowed to build until they require very large corrections.  But the faster adjustment process does raise some warning flags.  Although the newer technologies have clearly allowed firms to make more informed decisions, business managers throughout the economy also are likely responding to much of the same enhanced body of information.  As a consequence, firms appear to be acting in far closer alignment with one another than in decades past.  The result is not only a faster adjustment, but one that is potentially more synchronized, compressing changes into an even shorter time frame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis very rapidity with which the current adjustment is proceeding raises another concern, of a different nature.  While technology has quickened production adjustments, human nature remains unaltered.  We respond to a heightened pace of change and its associated uncertainty in the same way we always have.  We withdraw from action, postpone decisions, and generally hunker down until a renewed, more comprehensible basis for acting emerges.  In its extreme manifestation, many economic decisionmakers not only become risk averse but attempt to disengage from all risk.  This precludes taking any initiative, because risk is inherent in every action.  In the fall of 1998, for example, the desire for liquidity became so intense that financial markets seized up.  Indeed, investors even tended to shun risk-free, previously issued Treasury securities in favor of highly liquid, recently issued Treasury securities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut even when decisionmakers are only somewhat more risk averse, a process of retrenchment can occur.  Thus, although prospective long-term returns on new high-tech investment may change little, increased uncertainty can induce a higher discount of those returns and, hence, a reduced willingness to commit liquid resources to illiquid fixed investments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSuch a process presumably is now under way and arguably may take some time to run its course.  It is not that underlying demand for Internet, networking, and communications services has become less keen.  Instead, as I noted earlier, some suppliers seem to have reacted late to accelerating demand, have overcompensated in response, and then have been forced to retrench--a not-unusual occurrence in business decisionmaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA pace of change outstripping the ability of people to adjust is just as evident among consumers as among business decisionmakers.  When consumers become less secure in their jobs and finances, they retrench as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIt is difficult for economic policy to deal with the abruptness of a break in confidence.  There may not be a seamless transition from high to moderate to low confidence on the part of businesses, investors, and consumers.  Looking back at recent cyclical episodes, we see that the change in attitudes has often been sudden.  In earlier testimony, I likened this process to water backing up against a dam that is finally breached.  The torrent carries with it most remnants of certainty and euphoria that built up in earlier periods.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis unpredictable rending of confidence is one reason that recessions are so difficult to forecast.  They may not be just changes in degree from a period of economic expansion, but a different process engendered by fear.  Our economic models have never been particularly successful in capturing a process driven in large part by nonrational behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor this reason, changes in consumer confidence will require close scrutiny in the period ahead, especially after the steep falloff of recent months.  But for now, at least, the weakness in sales of motor vehicles and homes has been modest, suggesting that consumers have retained enough confidence to make longer-term commitments; and, as I pointed out earlier, expected earnings growth over the longer-run continues to be elevated.  Obviously, if the forces contributing to long-term productivity growth remain intact, the degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited.  In that event, prospects for high productivity growth should, with time, bolster both consumption and investment demand.  Before long in this scenario, excess inventories would be run off to desired levels.  Higher demand should also facilitate the \\r\\nworking-off of a presumed excess capital stock, though, doubtless, at a more modest pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tStill, as the FOMC noted in its last announcement, for the period ahead, downside risks predominate.  In addition to the possibility of a break in confidence, we don't know how far the adjustment of the stocks of consumer durables and business capital equipment has come.  Also, foreign economies appear to be slowing, which could damp demands for exports; and continued nervousness is evident in the behavior of participants in financial markets, keeping risk spreads relatively elevated.   \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause the advanced supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing technologies may have quickened the pace of adjustment in production and incomes and correspondingly increased the stress on confidence, the Federal Reserve has seen the need to respond more aggressively than had been our wont in earlier decades.  Economic policymaking could not, and should not, remain unaltered in the face of major changes in the speed of economic processes.  Fortunately, the very advances in technology that have quickened economic adjustments have also enhanced our capacity for real-time surveillance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs I pointed out earlier, demand has been depressed by the rise in energy prices as well as by the needed slowing in the pace of accumulation of business capital and consumer durable assets.  The sharp rise in energy costs pressed down on profit margins still further in the fourth quarter.  About a quarter of the rise in total unit costs of nonfinancial, nonenergy corporations reflected a rise in energy costs.  The 12 percent rise in natural gas prices last quarter contributed directly, and indirectly through its effects on the cost of electrical power generation, about one-fourth of the rise in overall energy costs for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations; increases in oil prices accounted for the remainder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, a significant part of the margin squeeze not directly attributable to higher energy costs probably has reflected the effects of the moderation in consumer outlays that, in turn, has been due in part to higher costs of energy, especially for natural gas.  Hence, it is likely that energy cost increases contributed significantly more to the deteriorating profitability of nonfinancial, non-energy corporations in the fourth quarter than is suggested by the energy-related rise in total unit costs alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo be sure, the higher energy expenses of households and most businesses represent a transfer of income to producers of energy.  But the capital investment of domestic energy producers, and, very likely, consumption by their owners, have provided only a small offset to the constraining effects of higher energy costs on spending by most Americans.  Moreover, a significant part of the extra expense is sent overseas to foreign energy producers, whose demand for exports from the United States is unlikely to rise enough to compensate for the reduction in domestic spending, especially in the short-run.  Thus, given the evident inability of energy users, constrained by intense competition for their own products, to pass on much of their cost increases, the rise in energy costs does not appear to have had broad inflationary effects, in contrast to some previous episodes when inflation expectations were not as well anchored.  Rather, the most prominent effects have been to depress aggregate demand.  The recent decline in energy prices and further declines anticipated by futures markets, should they occur, would tend to boost purchasing power and be an important factor supporting a recovery in demand growth over coming quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn summary, then, although the sources of long-term strength of our economy remain in place, excesses built up in 1999 and early 2000 have engendered a retrenchment that has yet to run its full course.  This retrenchment has been prompt, in part because new technologies have enabled businesses to respond more rapidly to emerging excesses.  Accordingly, to foster financial conditions conducive to the economy's realizing its long-term strengths, the Federal Reserve has quickened the pace of\"]\n"

      "[\"year has confronted an economy that slowed sharply late last year and has remained weak this year, following an extraordinary period of buoyant expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy aggressively easing the stance of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has moved to support demand and, we trust, help lay the groundwork for the economy to achieve maximum sustainable growth.  Our accelerated action reflected the pronounced downshift in economic activity, which was accentuated by the especially prompt and synchronous adjustment of production by businesses utilizing the faster flow of information coming from the adoption of new technologies.  A rapid and sizable easing was made possible by reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations, which helped to keep underlying inflation at a modest rate, and by the prospect that inflation would remain contained as resource utilization eased and energy prices backed down.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition to the more accommodative stance of monetary policy, demand should be assisted going forward by the effects of the tax cut, by falling energy costs, by the spur to production once businesses work down their inventories to more comfortable levels, and, most important, by the inducement to resume increases in capital spending.  That inducement should be provided by the continuation of cost-saving opportunities associated with rapid technological innovation.  Such innovation has been the driving force raising the growth of structural productivity over the last half-dozen years.  To be sure, measured productivity has softened in recent quarters, but by no more than one would anticipate from cyclical influences layered on top of a faster long-term trend. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut the uncertainties surrounding the current economic situation are considerable, and, until we see more concrete evidence that the adjustments of inventories and capital spending are well along, the risks would seem to remain mostly tilted toward weakness in the economy.  Still, the FOMC opted for a smaller policy move at our last meeting because we recognized that the effects of policy actions are felt with a lag, and, with our cumulative 2-3/4 percentage points of easing this year, we have moved a considerable distance in the direction of monetary stimulus.  Certainly, should conditions warrant, we may need to ease further, but we must not lose sight of the prerequisite of longer-run price stability for realizing the economy's full growth potential over time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tDespite the recent economic slowdown, the past decade has been extraordinary for the American economy.  The synergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the growth rate of structural productivity.  The capitalization of those higher expected returns lifted equity prices, which in turn contributed to a substantial pickup in household spending on a broad range of goods and services, especially on new homes and durable goods.  This increase in spending by both households and businesses exceeded even the enhanced rise in real household incomes and business earnings.  The evident attractiveness of investment opportunities in the United States induced substantial inflows of funds from abroad, raising the dollar's exchange rate while financing a growing portion of domestic spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy early 2000, the surge in household and business purchases had increased growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goods and business capital equipment to rates that could not be sustained.  Even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in some cases new supply was coming on even faster.  Overall, capacity in high-tech manufacturing industries, for example, rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in excess of its already rapid rate of increase over the previous three years.  Hence, a temporary glut in these industries and falling short-term prospective rates of return were inevitable at some point.  This tendency was reinforced by a more realistic evaluation of the prospects for returns on some high-tech investments, which, while still quite elevated by historical standards, apparently could not measure up to the previous exaggerated hopes.  Moreover, as I testified before this Committee last year, the economy as a whole was growing at an unsustainable pace, drawing further on an already diminished pool of available workers and relying increasingly on savings from abroad.  Clearly, some moderation in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the economy was to progress along a more balanced growth path. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t In the event, the adjustment occurred much faster than most businesses anticipated, with the slowdown likely intensified by the rise in the cost of energy that until quite recently had drained businesses and households of purchasing power.  Growth of outlays of consumer durable goods slowed in the middle of 2000, and shipments of nondefense capital goods have declined since autumn. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, weakness emerged more recently among our trading partners in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.  The interaction of slowdowns in a number of countries simultaneously has magnified the softening each of the individual economies would have experienced on its own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause the extent of the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses, some backup in inventories occurred, especially in the United States.  Innovations, such as more advanced supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing technologies, have enabled firms to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in sales.  But these improvements apparently have not solved the thornier problem of correctly anticipating demand.  Although inventory-sales ratios in most industries rose only moderately, those measures should be judged against businesses' desired levels.  In this regard, extrapolation of the downtrend in inventory-sales ratios over the past decade suggests that considerable imbalances emerged late last year.  Confirming this impression, purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector reported in January that inventories in the hands of their customers had risen to excessively high levels. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a result, a round of inventory rebalancing was undertaken, and the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of 2000 intensified.  The adjustment process started late last year when manufacturers began to cut production to stem the accumulation of unwanted inventories.  But inventories did not actually begin falling until early this year as producers decreased output levels considerably further. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMuch of the inventory reduction in the first quarter reflected a dramatic scaling back of motor vehicle assemblies.   However, inventories of computers, semiconductors, and communications products continued to build into the first quarter, and these stocks are only belatedly being brought under control.  As best we can judge, some progress seems to have been made on inventories of semiconductors and computers, but little gain is apparent with respect to communications equipment.  Inventories of high-tech products overall have probably been reduced a bit, but a period of substantial liquidation of stocks still seemingly lies ahead for these products. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor all inventories, the rate of liquidation appears to have been especially pronounced this winter, and the available data suggest that it continued, though perhaps at a more moderate pace, this spring.  A not inconsequential proportion of the current liquidation undoubtedly is of imported products, and thus will presumably affect foreign production, but most of the adjustment has fallen on domestic producers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAt some point, inventory liquidation will come to an end, and its termination will spur production and incomes.  Of course, the timing and force with which that process of recovery plays out will depend on the behavior of final demand.  In that regard, the demand for capital equipment, particularly in the near term, could pose a continuing problem.  Despite evidence that expected long-term rates of return on the newer technologies remain high, growth of investment in equipment and software has turned decidedly negative.  Sharp increases in uncertainties about the short-term outlook have significantly foreshortened the time frame over which businesses are requiring new capital projects to pay off.  The consequent heavier discounts applied to those long-term expectations have induced a major scaling back of new capital spending initiatives, though one that presumably is not long-lasting given the continuing inducements to embody improving technologies in new capital equipment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, a deterioration in sales, profitability, and cash flow has exacerbated the weakness in capital spending.  Pressures on profit margins have been unrelenting.  Although earnings weakness has been most pronounced for high-tech firms, where the previous extraordinary pace of expansion left oversupply in its wake, weakness is evident virtually across the board, including most recently in earnings of the foreign affiliates of American firms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMuch of the squeeze on profit margins of domestic operations results from a rise in unit labor costs.  Gains in compensation per hour picked up over the past year or so, responding to a long period of tight labor markets, the earlier acceleration of productivity, and the effects of an energy-induced run-up in consumer prices.  The faster upward movement in hourly compensation, coupled with the cyclical slowdown in the growth of output per hour, has elevated the rate of increase in unit labor costs.  In part, fixed costs, nonlabor as well as labor, are being spread over a smaller production base for many industries. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe surge in energy costs has also pressed down on profit margins, especially in the fourth and first quarters.  In fact, a substantial portion of the rise in total costs of domestic nonfinancial corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected the increase in energy costs.  The decline in energy prices since the spring, however, should be contributing positively to margins in the third quarter.  Moreover, the rate of increase in compensation is likely to moderate, with inflation expectations contained and labor markets becoming less taut in response to the slower pace of growth in economic activity.  In addition, continued rapid gains in structural productivity should help to suppress the rise in unit labor costs over time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEventually, the high-tech correction will abate, and these industries will reestablish themselves as a solidly expanding, though less frenetic, part of our economy.  When they do, growth in that sector presumably will not return to the outsized 50 percent annual growth rates of last year, but rather to a more sustainable pace. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOf course, investment spending ultimately depends on the strength of consumer demand for goods and services.  Here, too, longer-run increases in real incomes of consumers  engendered by the rapid advances in structural productivity should provide support to demand over time.  And thus far this year, consumer spending has indeed risen further, presumably assisted in part by a continued rapid growth in the market value of homes, from which a significant amount of equity is being extracted.  Moreover, household disposable income is now being bolstered by tax cuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut there are also downside risks to consumer spending over the next few quarters.  Importantly, the same pressure on profits and the heightened sense of risk that have held down investment have also lowered equity prices and reduced household wealth despite the rise in home equity.  We can expect the decline in stock market wealth that has occurred over the past year to restrain the growth of household spending relative to income, just as the previous increase gave an extra spur to household demand.  Furthermore, while most survey measures suggest consumer sentiment has stabilized recently, softer job markets could induce a further deterioration in confidence and spending intentions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhile this litany of risks should not be downplayed, it is notable how well the U.S. economy has withstood the many negative forces weighing on it.  Economic activity has held up remarkably in the face of a difficult adjustment toward a more sustainable pattern of expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe economic developments of the last couple of years have been a particular challenge for monetary policy.  Once the financial crises of late 1998 that followed the Russian default eased, efforts to address Y2K problems and growing optimism--if not euphoria--about profit opportunities produced a surge in investment, particularly in high-tech equipment and software.  The upswing outstripped what the nation could finance on a sustainable basis from domestic saving and funds attracted from abroad. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe shortfall of saving to finance investment showed through in a significant rise in average real long-term corporate interest rates starting in early 1999.  By June of that year, it was evident to the Federal Open Market Committee that to continue to hold the funds rate at the then-prevailing level of 4-3/4 percent in the face of rising real long-term corporate rates would have required a major infusion of liquidity into an economy already threatening to overheat. In fact, the increase in our target federal funds rate of 175 basis points through May of 2000 barely \\r\\nslowed the expansion of liquidity, judging from the M2 measure of the money supply, whose rate of increase declined only modestly through the tightening period. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy summer of last year, it started to become apparent that the growth of demand finally was slowing, and seemingly by enough to bring it into approximate alignment with the expansion of potential supply, as indicated by the fact that the pool of available labor was no longer being drawn down.  It was well into autumn, however, before one could be confident that the growth of aggregate demand had softened enough to bring it into a more lasting balance with potential supply.  Growth continued to decline to a point that by our December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided that the time to counter cumulative economic weakness was close at hand.  We altered our assessment of the risks to the economy, and with incoming information following the meeting continuing to be downbeat, we took our first easing action on January 3.  We viewed the faster downshift in economic activity, in part a consequence of the technology-enhanced speed and volume of information flows, as calling for a quicker pace of policy adjustment.  Acting on that view, we have lowered the federal funds rate 2-3/4 percentage points since the turn of the year, with last month's action leaving the federal funds rate at 3-3/4 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMost long-term interest rates, however, have barely budged despite the appreciable reductions in short-term rates since the beginning of the year.  This has led many commentators to ask whether inflation expectations have risen.  Surely, one reason long-term rates have held up is changed expectations in the Treasury market, as forecasts of the unified budget surplus were revised down, indicating that the supplies of outstanding marketable Treasury debt are unlikely to shrink as rapidly as previously anticipated.  Beyond that, it is difficult to judge whether long-term rates have held up because of firming inflation expectations or a belief that economic growth is likely to strengthen, spurring a rise in real long-term rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOne measure often useful in separating the real interest rates from inflation expectations is the spread between rates on nominal ten-year Treasury notes and inflation-indexed notes of similar maturity.  That spread rose more than three-fourths of a percentage point through the first five months of this year, a not insignificant change, though half of that increase has been reversed since.  By the nature of the indexed instrument, the spread between it and the comparable nominal rate reflects expected CPI inflation.  While actual CPI inflation has picked up this year, this rise has not been mirrored uniformly in other broad price measures.  For example, there has been little, if any, acceleration in the index of core personal consumption expenditure prices, which we consider to be a more reliable measure of inflation.  Moreover, survey readings on long term inflation expectations have remained quite stable. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by business people underscores the quiescence of inflationary pressures.  Businesses are experiencing the effects of softer demand in product markets overall, but these effects have been especially marked for many producers at earlier stages of processing, where prices generally have been flat to down thus far this year.  With energy prices now also moving lower and the lessening of tautness in labor markets expected to damp wage increases, overall prices seem likely to be contained in the period ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tForecasts of inflation, however, like all economic forecasts, do not have an enviable record.  Faced with such uncertainties, a central bank's vigilance against inflation is more than a monetary policy cliche; it is, of course, the way we fulfill our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable growth. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA central bank can contain inflation over time under most conditions.  But do we have the capability to eliminate booms and busts in economic activity?  Can fiscal and monetary \\r\\npolicy acting at their optimum eliminate the business cycle, as some of the more optimistic followers of J.M. Keynes seemed to believe several decades ago?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe answer, in my judgment, is no, because there is no tool to change human nature.  Too often people are prone to recurring bouts of optimism and pessimism that manifest themselves from time to time in the buildup or cessation of speculative excesses.  As I have noted in recent years, our only realistic response to a speculative bubble is to lean against the economic pressures that may accompany a rise in asset prices, bubble or not, and address forcefully the consequences of a sharp deflation of asset prices should they occur. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhile we are limited in our ability to anticipate and act on asset price bubbles, expectations about future economic developments nonetheless inevitably play a crucial role in our policymaking.  If we react only to past or current developments, lags in the effects of monetary policy could end up destabilizing the economy, as history has amply demonstrated. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause accurate point forecasts are extraordinarily difficult to fashion, we are forced also to consider the probability distribution of possible economic outcomes.  Against these distributions, we endeavor to judge the possible consequences of various alternative policy actions, especially the consequences of a policy mistake.  We recognize that this policy process may require substantial swings in the federal funds rate over time to help stabilize the economy, as, for example, recurring bouts of consumer and business optimism and pessimism drive economic activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn reducing the federal funds rate so substantially this year, we have been responding to our judgment that a good part of the recent weakening of demand was likely to persist for a while, and that there were significant downside risks even to a reduced central tendency forecast.  \\r\\nMoreover, with inflation low and likely to be contained, the main threat to satisfactory economic performance appeared to come from excessive weakness in activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a consequence of the policy actions of the FOMC, some of the stringent financial conditions evident late last year have been eased.  Real interest rates are down on a wide variety of borrowing instruments.  Private rates have benefited from some narrowing of risk premiums in many markets.  And the growth of liquidity, as measured by M2, has picked up.  More recently, incoming data on economic activity have turned from persistently negative to more mixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe period of sub-par economic performance, however, is not yet over, and we are not free of the risk that economic weakness will be greater than currently anticipated, and require further policy response.  That weakness could arise from softer demand abroad as well as from domestic developments.  But we need also to be aware that our front-loaded policy actions this year coupled with the tax cuts under way should be increasingly affecting economic activity as the year progresses. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe views of the Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents reflect this assessment. While recognizing the downside risks to their current forecast, most anticipate at least a slight strengthening of real activity later this year.  This is implied by the central tendency of their individual projections, which is for real GDP growth over all four quarters of 2001 of 1-1/4 to 2 percent.  Next year, the comparable figures are 3 to 3-1/4 percent.  The civilian unemployment rate is projected to rise further over the second half of the year, with a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent by the fourth quarter and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent four quarters later.  This easing of pressures in product and labor markets lies behind the central tendency for PCE price inflation of 2 to 2-1/2 percent over the four quarters of this year and 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent next year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs for the years beyond this horizon, there is still, in my judgment, ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations that has elevated the underlying growth in productivity to a rate significantly above that of the two decades preceding 1995.  By all evidence, we are not yet dealing with maturing technologies that, after having sparkled for a half-decade, are now in the process of fizzling out.  To the contrary, once the forces that are currently containing investment initiatives dissipate, new applications of innovative technologies should again strengthen demand for capital equipment and restore solid economic growth over time\"]\n"

      "['that the American economy, which grew more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably.  At the same time, inflation has remained largely contained.  An increase in the overall rate of inflation in 1999 was mainly a result of higher energy prices.  Importantly, unit labor costs actually declined in the second half of the year.  Indeed, still-preliminary data indicate that total unit cost increases last year remained extraordinarily low, even as the business expansion approached a record nine years.  Domestic operating profit margins, after sagging for eighteen months, apparently turned up again in the fourth quarter, and profit expectations for major corporations for the first quarter have been undergoing upward revisions since the beginning of the year--scarcely an indication of imminent', \"unprecedented in my half-century of observing the American economy, is a continuing acceleration in productivity.  Nonfarm business output per workhour increased 3-1/4 percent during the past year--likely more than 4 percent when measured by nonfarm business income.  Security analysts' projections of long-term earnings, an indicator of expectations of company productivity, continued to be revised upward in January, extending a string of upward revisions that began in early 1995.  One result of this remarkable economic performance has been a pronounced increase in living standards for the majority of Americans.  Another has been a labor market that has provided job opportunities for large numbers of people previously struggling to get on the first rung of a ladder leading to training, skills, and permanent employment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tYet those profoundly beneficial forces driving the American economy to competitive excellence are also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained, threaten our continuing prosperity.  Accelerating productivity entails a matching acceleration in the potential output of goods and services and a corresponding rise in real incomes available to purchase the new output.  The problem is that the pickup in productivity tends to create even greater increases in aggregate demand than in potential aggregate supply.  This occurs principally because a rise in structural productivity growth has its counterpart in higher expectations for long-term corporate earnings.  This, in turn, not only spurs business investment but also increases stock prices and the market value of assets held by households, creating additional purchasing power for which no additional goods or services have yet been produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tHistorical evidence suggests that perhaps three to four cents out of every additional dollar of stock market wealth eventually is reflected in increased consumer purchases.  The sharp rise in the amount of consumer outlays relative to disposable incomes in recent years, and the corresponding fall in the saving rate, has been consistent with this so-called wealth effect on household purchases.  Moreover, higher stock prices, by lowering the cost of equity capital, have helped to support the boom in capital spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOutlays prompted by capital gains in excess of increases in income, as best we can judge, have added about 1 percentage point to annual growth of gross domestic purchases, on average, over the past five years.  The additional growth in spending of recent years that has accompanied these wealth gains as well as other supporting influences on the economy appears to have been met in about equal measure from increased net imports and from goods and services produced by the net increase in newly hired workers over and above the normal growth of the work force, including a substantial net inflow of workers from abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut these safety valves that have been supplying goods and services to meet the recent increments to purchasing power largely generated by capital gains cannot be expected to absorb an excess of demand over supply indefinitely.  First, growing net imports and a widening current account deficit require ever larger portfolio and direct foreign investments in the United States, an outcome that cannot continue without limit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tImbalances in the labor markets perhaps may have even more serious implications for inflation pressures.  While the pool of officially unemployed and those otherwise willing to work may continue to shrink, as it has persistently over the past seven years, there is an effective limit to new hiring, unless immigration is uncapped.  At some point in the continuous reduction in the number of available workers willing to take jobs, short of the repeal of the law of supply and demand, wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity.  This would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs would be expected, imbalances between demand and potential supply in markets for goods and services are being mirrored in the financial markets by an excess in the demand for funds.  As a consequence, market interest rates are already moving in the direction of containing the excess of demand in financial markets and therefore in product markets as well.  For example, BBB corporate bond rates adjusted for inflation expectations have risen by more than 1 percentage point during the past two years.  However, to date, rising business earnings expectations and declining compensation for risk have more than offset the effects of this increase, propelling equity prices and the wealth effect higher.  Should this process continue, however, with the assistance of a monetary policy vigilant against emerging macroeconomic imbalances, real long-term rates will at some point be high enough to finally balance demand with supply at the economy's potential in both the financial and product markets.  Other things equal, this condition will involve equity discount factors high enough to bring the rise in asset values into line with that of household incomes, thereby stemming the impetus to consumption relative to income that has come from rising wealth.  This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values--although that, of course, can happen at any time for any number of reasons--but rather that these values will increase no faster than household incomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause there are limits to the amount of goods and services that can be supplied from increasing net imports and by drawing on a limited pool of persons willing to work, it necessarily follows that consumption cannot keep rising faster than income.  Moreover, outsized increases in wealth cannot persist indefinitely either.  For so long as the levels of  consumption and investment are sensitive to asset values, equity values increasing at a pace faster than income, other things equal, will induce a rise in overall demand in excess of potential supply.  But that situation cannot persist without limit because the supply safety valves are themselves limited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith foreign economies strengthening and labor markets already tight, how the current wealth effect is finally contained will determine whether the extraordinary expansion that it has helped foster can slow to a sustainable pace, without destabilizing the\", 'there are few signs to date of slowing in the pace of innovation and the spread of our newer technologies that, as I have indicated in previous testimonies, have been at the root of our extraordinary productivity improvement.  Indeed, some analysts conjecture that we still may be in the earlier stages of the rapid adoption of new technologies and not yet in sight of the stage when this wave of innovation will crest.  With so few examples in our history, there is very little basis for determining the particular stage of development through which we are currently passing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWithout doubt, the synergies of the microprocessor, laser, fiber-optic glass, and satellite technologies have brought quantum advances in information availability.  These advances, in turn, have dramatically decreased business operational uncertainties and risk premiums and, thereby, have engendered major cost reductions and productivity advances.  There seems little question that further major advances lie ahead.  What is uncertain is the future pace of the application of these innovations, because it is this pace that governs the rate of change in productivity and economic potential.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMonetary policy, of course, did not produce the intellectual insights behind the technological advances that have been responsible for the recent phenomenal reshaping of our economic landscape.  It has, however, been instrumental, we trust, in establishing a stable financial and economic environment with low inflation that is conducive to the investments that have exploited these innovative technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFederal budget policy has also played a pivotal role.  The emergence of surpluses in the unified budget and of the associated increase in government saving over the past few years has been exceptionally important to the balance of the expansion, because the surpluses have been absorbing a portion of the potential excess of demand over sustainable supply associated partly with the wealth effect.  Moreover, because the surpluses are augmenting the pool of domestic saving, they have held interest rates below the levels that otherwise would have been needed to achieve financial and economic balance during this period of exceptional economic growth.  They have, in effect, helped to finance and sustain the productive private investment that has been key to capturing the benefits of the newer technologies that, in turn, have boosted the long-term growth potential of the U.S. economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe recent good news on the budget suggests that our longer-run prospects for continuing this beneficial process of recycling savings from the public to the private sectors have improved greatly in recent years.   Nonetheless, budget outlays are expected to come under mounting pressure as the baby boom generation moves into retirement, a process that gets under way a decade from now.  Maintaining the surpluses and using them to repay debt over coming years will continue to be an important way the federal government can encourage productivity-enhancing investment and rising standards of living.

Thus, we cannot afford to be lulled into letting down our guard on budgetary matters, an issue to which I shall return', \"is clouded by a number of uncertainties, the central tendencies of the projections of the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents imply continued good economic performance in the United States.  Most of them expect economic growth to slow somewhat this year, easing into the 3-1/2 to  3-3/4 percent area.  The unemployment rate would remain in the neighborhood of 4 to 4-1/4 percent.  The rate of inflation for total personal consumption expenditures is expected to be 1-3/4 to 2 percent, at or a bit below the rate in 1999, which was elevated by rising energy prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn preparing these forecasts, the Federal Open Market Committee members had to consider several of the crucial demand- and supply-side forces I referred to earlier.  Continued favorable developments in labor productivity are anticipated both to raise the economy's capacity to produce and, through its supporting effects on real incomes and asset values, to boost private domestic demand.  When productivity-driven wealth increases were spurring demand a few years ago, the effects on resource utilization and inflation pressures were offset in part by the effects of weakening foreign economies and a rising foreign exchange value of the dollar, which depressed exports and encouraged imports.  Last year, with the welcome recovery of foreign economies and with the leveling out of the dollar, these factors holding down demand and prices in the United States started to unwind.  Strong growth in foreign economic activity is expected to continue this year, and, other things equal, the effect of the previous appreciation of the dollar should wane, augmenting demand on U.S. resources and lessening one source of downward pressure on our prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs a consequence, the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply may well depend on restraint on domestic demand, which continues to be buoyed by the lagged effects of increases in stock market valuations.  Accordingly, the appreciable increases in both nominal and real intermediate- and long-term interest rates over the last two years should act as a needed restraining influence in the period ahead.  However, to date, interest-sensitive spending has remained robust, and the FOMC will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity continue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAchieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depth of our various buffers against inflationary pressures.  Labor markets, for example, have tightened in recent years as demand has persistently outstripped even accelerating potential supply.  As I have previously noted, we cannot be sure in an environment with so little historical precedent what degree of labor market tautness could begin to push unit costs and prices up more rapidly.  We know, however, that there is a limit, and we can be sure that the smaller the pool of people without jobs willing to take them, the closer we are to that limit.  As the FOMC indicated after its last meeting, the risks still seem to be weighted on the side of building inflation pressures.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA central bank can best contribute to economic growth and rising standards of living by fostering a financial environment that promotes overall balance in the economy and price stability.  Maintaining an environment of effective price stability is essential, because the experience in the United States and abroad has underscored that low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for healthy, balanced, economic expansion.  Sustained expansion and price stability provide a backdrop against which workers and businesses can respond to signals from the marketplace in ways that make most efficient use of\", 'should like to revisit some issues of federal budget policy that I have addressed in previous congressional testimony.  Some modest erosion in fiscal discipline resulted last year through the use of the \"emergency\" spending initiatives and some \"creative accounting.\"  Although somewhat disappointing, that erosion was small relative to the influence of the wise choice of the Administration and the Congress to allow the bulk of the unified budget surpluses projected for the next several years to build and retire debt to the public.  The idea that we should stop borrowing from the social security trust fund to finance other outlays has gained surprising--and welcome--traction, and it establishes, in effect, a new budgetary framework that is centered on the on-budget surplus and how it should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis new framework is useful because it offers a clear objective that should strengthen budgetary discipline.  It moves the budget process closer to accrual accounting, the private-sector norm, and--I would hope--the ultimate objective of federal budget accounting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe new budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration generally look reasonable.  But, as many analysts have stressed, these estimates represent a midrange of possible outcomes for the economy and the budget, and actual budgetary results could deviate quite significantly from current expectations.  Some of the uncertainty centers on the likelihood that the recent spectacular growth of labor productivity will persist over the years ahead.  Like many private forecasters, the CBO and the Office of Management and Budget assume that productivity growth will drop back somewhat from the recent stepped-up pace.  But a distinct possibility, as I pointed out earlier, is that the development and diffusion of new technologies in the current wave of innovation may still be at a relatively early stage and that the scope for further acceleration of productivity is thus greater than is embodied in these budget projections.  If so, the outlook for budget surpluses would be even brighter than is now anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut there are significant downside risks to the budget outlook as well.  One is our limited knowledge of the forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years.  Of course, a good part of that surge is due to the extraordinary rise in the market value of assets which, as I noted earlier, cannot be sustained at the pace of recent years.  But that is not the entire story.  These relationships are complex, and until we have detailed tabulations compiled from actual tax returns, we shall not really know why individual tax revenues, relative to income, have been even higher than would have been predicted from rising asset values and bracket creep.  Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that this so-called \"tax surprise,\" which has figured so prominently in the improved budget picture of recent years, will dissipate or reverse.  If this were to happen, the projected surpluses, even with current economic assumptions, would shrink appreciably and perhaps disappear.  Such an outcome would be especially likely if adverse developments occurred in other parts of the budget as well--for example, if the recent slowdown in health care spending were to be followed by a sharper pickup than is assumed in current budget projections.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnother consideration that argues for letting the unified surpluses build is that the budget is still significantly short of balance when measured on an accrual basis.  If social security, for example, were measured on such a basis, counting benefits when they are earned by workers rather than when they are paid out, that program would have shown a substantial deficit last year.  The deficit would have been large enough to push the total federal budget into the red,  and an accrual-based budget measure could conceivably record noticeable deficits over the next few years, rather than the surpluses now indicated by the official projections for either the total unified budget or the on-budget accounts.  Such accruals take account of still growing contingent liabilities that, under most reasonable sets of actuarial assumptions, currently amount to many trillions of dollars for social security benefits alone. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEven if accrual accounting is set aside, it might still be prudent to eschew new longer-term, potentially irreversible commitments until we are assured that the on-budget surplus projections are less conjectural than they are, of necessity, today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAllowing surpluses to reduce the debt to the public, rather than for all practical purposes irrevocably committing to their disposition in advance, can be viewed as a holding action pending the clarification of the true underlying budget outcomes of the next few years.  Debt repaid can very readily be reborrowed to fund delayed initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMore fundamentally, the growth potential of our economy under current circumstances is best served, in my judgment, by allowing the unified budget surpluses presently in train to materialize and thereby reduce Treasury debt held by the public.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tYet I recognize that growing budget surpluses may be politically infeasible to defend.  If this proves to be the case, as I have also testified previously, the likelihood of maintaining a still satisfactory overall budget position over the longer run is greater, I believe, if surpluses are used to lower tax rates rather than to embark on new spending programs.  History illustrates the difficulties of keeping spending in check, especially in programs that are open-ended commitments, which too often have led to larger outlays than initially envisioned.  Decisions to reduce taxes, however, are more likely to be contained by the need to maintain an adequate revenue base to finance necessary government services.  Moreover, especially if designed to lower marginal rates, tax reductions can offer favorable incentives', 'a new century as well as a new year, the time is opportune to reflect on the basic characteristics of our economic system that have brought about our success in recent years.  Competitive and open markets, the rule of law, fiscal discipline, and a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship should continue to undergird rapid innovation and enhanced productivity that in turn should foster a sustained further rise in living standards.  It would be imprudent, however, to presume that the business cycle has been purged from market economies so long as human expectations are subject to bouts of euphoria and disillusionment.  We can only anticipate that we will readily take such diversions in stride and trust that beneficent fundamentals will provide the framework for continued economic progress well']\n"

      "[\"confronting a complex set of challenges in judging the stance of policy that will best contribute to sustaining the strong and long-running expansion of our economy.  The challenges will be no less in coming months as we judge whether ongoing adjustments in supply and demand will be sufficient to prevent distortions that would undermine the economy's extraordinary performance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor some time now, the growth of aggregate demand has exceeded the expansion of production potential.  Technological innovations have boosted the growth rate of potential, but as I noted in my testimony last February, the effects of this process also have spurred aggregate demand.  It has been clear to us that, with labor markets already quite tight, a continuing disparity between the growth of demand and potential supply would produce disruptive imbalances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA key element in this disparity has been the very rapid growth of consumption resulting from the effects on spending of the remarkable rise in household wealth.  However, the growth in household spending has slowed noticeably this spring from the unusually rapid pace observed late in 1999 and early this year.  Some argue that this slowing is a pause following the surge in demand through the warmer-than-normal winter months and hence a reacceleration can be expected later this year.  Certainly, we have seen slowdowns in spending during this near-decade-long expansion that have proven temporary, with aggregate demand growth subsequently rebounding to an unsustainable pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut other analysts point to a number of factors that may be exerting more persistent restraint on spending.  One they cite is the flattening in equity prices, on net, this year.  They attribute much of the slowing of consumer spending to this diminution of the wealth effect through the spring and early summer.  This view looks to equity markets as a key influence on the trend in consumer spending over the rest of this year and next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnother factor said by some to account for the spending slowdown is the rising debt burden of households.  Interest and amortization as a percent of disposable income have risen materially during the past six years, as consumer and especially mortgage debt has climbed and, more recently, as interest rates have moved higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, the past year's rise in the price of oil has amounted to an annual $75 billion levy by foreign producers on domestic consumers of imported oil, the equivalent of a tax of roughly 1 percent of disposable income.  This burden is another likely source of the slowed growth in real consumption outlays in recent months, though one that may prove to be largely transitory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMentioned less prominently have been the effects of the faster increase in the stock of consumer durable assets--both household durable goods and houses--in the last several years, a rate of increase that history tells us is usually followed by a pause.  Stocks of household durable goods, including motor vehicles, are estimated to have increased at nearly a 6 percent annual rate over the past three years, a marked acceleration from the growth rate of the previous ten years.  The number of cars and light trucks owned or leased by households, for example, apparently has continued to rise in recent years despite having reached nearly 1-3/4 vehicles per household by the mid-1990s.  Notwithstanding their recent slowing, sales of new homes continue at extraordinarily high levels relative to new household formations.  While we will not know for sure until the 2000 census is tabulated, the surge in new home sales is strong evidence that the growth of owner-occupied homes has accelerated during the past five years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThose who focus on the high and rising stocks of durable assets point out that even without the rise in interest rates, an eventual leveling out or some tapering off of purchases of durable goods and construction of single-family housing would be expected.  Reflecting both higher interest rates and higher stocks of housing, starts of new housing units have fallen off of late.  If that slowing were to persist, some reduction in the rapid pace of accumulation of household appliances across our more than hundred million households would not come as a surprise, nor would a slowdown in vehicle demand so often historically associated with declines in housing demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tInventories of durable assets in households are just as formidable a factor in new production as inventories at manufacturing and trade establishments.  The notion that consumer spending and housing construction may be slowing because the stock of consumer durables and houses may be running into upside resistance is a credible addition to the possible explanations of current consumer trends.  This effect on spending would be reinforced by the waning effects of gains in wealth. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBecause the softness in outlay growth is so recent, all of the aforementioned hypotheses, of course, must be provisional.  It is certainly premature to make a definitive assessment of either the recent trends in household spending or what they mean.  But it is clear that, for the time being at least, the increase in spending on consumer goods and houses has come down several notches, albeit from very high levels. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn one sense, the more important question for the longer-term economic outlook is the extent of any productivity slowdown that might accompany a more subdued pace of production and consumer spending, should it persist.  The behavior of productivity under such circumstances will be a revealing test of just how much of the rapid growth of productivity in recent years has represented structural change as distinct from cyclical aberrations and, hence, how truly different the developments of the past five years have been.  At issue is how much of the current downshift in our overall economic growth rate can be accounted for by reduced growth in output per hour and how much by slowed increases in hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSo far there is little evidence to undermine the notion that most of the productivity increase of recent years has been structural and that structural productivity may still be accelerating.  New orders for capital equipment continue quite strong--so strong that the rise in unfilled orders has actually steepened in recent months.  Capital-deepening investment in a broad range of equipment embodying the newer productivity-enhancing technologies remains brisk.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo be sure, if current personal consumption outlays slow significantly further than the pattern now in train suggests, profit and sales expectations might be scaled back, possibly inducing some hesitancy in moving forward even with capital projects that appear quite profitable over the longer run.  In addition, the direct negative effects of the sharp recent runup in energy prices on profits as well as on sales expectations may temporarily damp capital spending.  Despite the marked decline over the past decades in the energy requirements per dollar of GDP, energy inputs are still a significant element in the cost structure of many American businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFor the moment, the dropoff in overall economic growth to date appears about matched by reduced growth in hours, suggesting continued strength in growth in output per hour.  The increase of production worker hours from March through June, for example, was at an annual rate of 1/2 percent compared with 3-1/4 percent the previous three months.  Of course, we do not have comprehensive measures of output on a monthly basis, but available data suggest a roughly comparable deceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA lower overall rate of economic growth that did not carry with it a significant deterioration in productivity growth obviously would be a desirable outcome.  It could conceivably slow or even bring to a halt the deterioration in the balance of overall demand and potential supply in our economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs I testified before this committee in February, domestic demand growth, influenced importantly by the wealth effect on consumer spending, has been running 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points at an annual rate in excess of even the higher, productivity-driven, growth in potential supply since late 1997.  That gap has been filled both by a marked rise in imports as a percent of GDP and by a marked increase in domestic production resulting both from significant immigration and from the employment of previously unutilized labor resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tI also pointed out in February that there are limits to how far net imports--or the broader measure, our current account deficit--can rise, or our pool of unemployed labor resources can fall.  As a consequence, the excess of the growth of domestic demand over potential supply must be closed before the resulting strains and imbalances undermine the economic expansion that now has reached 112 months, a record for peace or war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe current account deficit is a proxy for the increase in net claims against U.S. residents held by foreigners, mainly as debt, but increasingly as equities.  So long as foreigners continue to seek to hold ever-increasing quantities of dollar investments in their portfolios, as they obviously have been, the exchange rate for the dollar will remain firm.  Indeed, the same sharp rise in potential rates of return on new American investments that has been driving capital accumulation and accelerating productivity in the United States has also been inducing foreigners to expand their portfolios of American securities and direct investment.  The latest data published by the Department of Commerce indicate that the annual pace of direct plus portfolio investment by foreigners in the U.S. economy during the first quarter was more than two and one-half times its rate in 1995.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThere has to be a limit as to how much of the world's savings our residents can borrow at close to prevailing interest and exchange rates.  And a narrowing of disparities among global growth rates could induce a narrowing of rates of return here relative to those abroad that could adversely affect the propensity of foreigners to invest in the United States.  But obviously, so long as our rates of return appear to be unusually high, if not rising, balance of payments trends are less likely to pose a threat to our prosperity.  In addition, our burgeoning budget surpluses have clearly contributed to a fending off, if only temporarily, of some of the pressures on our balance of payments.  The stresses on the global savings pool resulting from the excess of domestic private investment demands over domestic private saving have been mitigated by the large federal budget surpluses that have developed of late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn addition, by substantially augmenting national saving, these budget surpluses have kept real interest rates at levels lower than they would have been otherwise.  This development has helped foster the investment boom that in recent years has contributed greatly to the strengthening of U.S. productivity and economic growth.  The Congress and the Administration have wisely avoided steps that would materially reduce these budget surpluses.  Continued fiscal discipline will contribute to maintaining robust expansion of the American economy in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tJust as there is a limit to our reliance on foreign saving, so is there a limit to the continuing drain on our unused labor resources.  Despite the ever-tightening labor market, as yet, gains in compensation per hour are not significantly outstripping gains in productivity.  But as I have argued previously, should labor markets continue to tighten, short of a repeal of the law of supply and demand, labor costs eventually would have to accelerate to levels threatening price stability and our continuing economic expansion.\\r\\n\\tThe more modest pace of increase in domestic final spending in recent months suggests that aggregate demand may be moving closer into line with the rate of advance in the economy's potential, given our continued impressive productivity growth.  Should these trends toward supply and demand balance persist, the ongoing need for ever-rising imports and for a further draining of our limited labor resources should ease or perhaps even end.  Should this favorable outcome prevail, the immediate threat to our prosperity from growing imbalances in our economy would abate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut as I indicated earlier, it is much too soon to conclude that these concerns are behind us.  We cannot yet be sure that the slower expansion of domestic final demand, at a pace more in line with potential supply, will persist.  Even if the growth rates of demand and potential supply move into better balance, there is still uncertainty about whether the current level of labor resource utilization can be maintained without generating increased cost and price pressures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs I have already noted, to date costs have been held in check by productivity gains.  But at the same time, inflation has picked up--even the core measures that do not include energy prices directly.  Higher rates of core inflation may mostly reflect the indirect effects of energy prices, but the Federal Reserve will need to be alert to the risks that high levels of resource utilization may put upward pressure on inflation.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMoreover, energy prices may pose a challenge to containing inflation.  Energy price changes represent a one-time shift in a set of important prices, but by themselves generally cannot drive an ongoing inflation process.  The key to whether such a process could get under way is inflation expectations.  To date, survey evidence, as well as readings from the Treasury's inflation-indexed securities, suggests that households and investors do not view the current energy price surge as affecting longer-term inflation.  But any deterioration in such expectations would pose a risk to the economic outlook. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs the financing requirements for our ever-rising capital investment needs mounted in recent years--beyond forthcoming domestic saving--real long-term interest rates rose to address this gap.  We at the Federal Reserve, responding to the same economic forces, have moved the overnight federal funds rate up 1-3/4 percentage points over the past year.  To have held to the federal funds rate of June 1999 would have required a massive increase in liquidity that would presumably have underwritten an acceleration of prices and, hence, an eventual curbing of economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy our meeting this June, the appraisal of all the foregoing issues led the Federal Open Market Committee to conclude that, while some signs of slower growth were evident and justified standing pat at least for the time being, they were not sufficiently compelling to alter our view that the risks remained more on the side of higher inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs indicated in their forecasts, FOMC members and nonvoting presidents expect that the long period of continuous economic expansion will be extended over the next year and one-half, but with growth at a somewhat slower pace than over the past several years.  For the current year, the central tendency of Board members' and Reserve Bank presidents' forecasts is for real GDP to increase 4 to 4-1/2 percent, suggesting a noticeable deceleration over the second half of 2000 from its likely pace over the first half.  The unemployment rate is projected to remain close to 4 percent.  This outlook is a little stronger than anticipated last February, no doubt owing primarily to the unexpectedly strong jump in output in the first quarter.  Mainly reflecting higher prices of energy products than had been foreseen, the central tendency for inflation this year in prices for personal consumption expenditures also has been revised up somewhat, to the vicinity of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tGiven the firmer financial conditions that have developed over the past eighteen months, the Committee expects economic growth to moderate somewhat next year.  Real output is anticipated to expand 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent, somewhat less rapidly than in recent years.  The unemployment rate is likely to remain close to its recent very low levels.  Energy prices could ease somewhat, helping to trim PCE inflation next year to around 2 to 2-1/2 percent, somewhat above\", 'a remarkable period of expansion for our economy.  Federal Reserve policy through this period has been required to react to a constantly evolving set of economic forces, often at variance with historical relationships, changing federal funds rates when events appeared to threaten our prosperity, and refraining from action when that appeared warranted.  Early in the expansion, for example, we kept rates unusually low for an extended period, when financial sector fragility held back the economy.  Most recently we have needed to raise rates to relatively high levels in real terms in response to the side effects of accelerating growth and related demand-supply imbalances.  Variations in the stance of policy--or keeping it the same--in response to evolving forces are made in the framework of an unchanging objective--to foster as best we can those financial conditions most likely to promote sustained economic expansion at the highest rate possible.  Maximum sustainable growth, as history so amply demonstrates, requires price stability.  Irrespective of the complexities of economic change, our primary goal is to find those policies that best contribute to a noninflationary environment and hence to growth.  The Federal Reserve, I trust, will always remain vigilant']\n"

      "[\"over the past year again performed admirably.  Despite the challenges presented by severe economic downturns in a number of foreign countries and episodic financial turmoil abroad and at home, our real GDP grew about 4 percent for a third straight year.  In 1998, 2-3/4 million jobs were created on net, bringing the total increase in payrolls to more than 18 million during the current economic expansion, which late last year became the longest in U.S. peacetime history.  Unemployment edged down further to a 4-1/4 percent rate, the lowest since 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnd despite taut labor markets, inflation also fell to its lowest rate in many decades by some broad measures, although a portion of this decline owed to decreases in oil, commodity, and other import prices that are unlikely to be repeated.  Hourly labor compensation adjusted for inflation posted further impressive gains.  Real compensation gains have been supported by robust advances in labor productivity, which in turn have partly reflected heavy investment in plant and equipment, often embodying innovative technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCan this favorable performance be sustained?  In many respects the fundamental underpinnings of the recent U.S. economic performance are strong.  Flexible markets and the shift to surplus on the books of the federal government are facilitating the build-up in cutting-edge capital stock.  That build-up in turn is spawning rapid advances in productivity that are helping to keep inflation well behaved.  The new technologies and the optimism of consumers and investors are supporting asset prices and sustaining spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut, after eight years of economic expansion, the economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions, implying considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook.  The robust increase of production has been using up our nation's spare labor resources, suggesting that recent strong growth in spending cannot continue without a pickup in inflation unless labor productivity growth increases significantly further.  Equity prices are high enough to raise questions about whether shares are overvalued.  The debt of the household and business sectors has mounted, as has the external debt of the country as a whole, reflecting the deepening current account deficit.  We remain vulnerable to rapidly changing conditions overseas, which, as we saw last summer, can be transmitted to U.S. markets quickly and traumatically.  I will be commenting on many of these issues as I review the developments of the past year and the prospects going forward.  In light of all these risks, monetary policy must be ready to move quickly in either direction should we perceive imbalances and distortions developing that could undermine\", \"economic performance over the past year was the continuing sharp expansion of business investment spending.  Competitive global markets and persisting technological advances both spurred the business drive to become more efficient and induced the price declines for many types of new equipment that made capital spending more attractive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBusiness success in enhancing productivity and the expectation of still further, perhaps accelerated, advances buoyed public optimism about profit prospects, which contributed to another sizable boost in equity prices.  Rising household wealth along with strong growth in real income, related to better pay, slower inflation, and expanding job opportunities, boosted consumption at the fastest clip in a decade and a half.  The gains in income and wealth last year, along with a further decrease in mortgage rates, also prompted considerable activity in the housing sector. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe impressive performance of the private sector was reflected in a continued improvement in the federal budget.  Burgeoning receipts, along with continuing restraint on federal spending, produced the first unified budget surplus in thirty years, allowing the Treasury to begin to pay down the federal debt held by the public.  This shift in the federal government's fiscal position has fostered an increase in overall national saving as a share of GDP to 17-1/4 percent from the 14-1/2 percent low reached in 1993.  This rise in national saving has helped to hold down real interest rates and to facilitate the financing of the boom in private investment spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tForeign savers have provided an additional source of funds for vigorous domestic investment.  The counterpart of our high and rising current account deficit has been ever-faster increases in the net indebtedness of U.S. residents to foreigners.  The rapid widening of the current account deficit has some disquieting aspects, especially when viewed in a longer-term context.  Foreigners presumably will not want to raise indefinitely the share of their portfolios in claims on the United States.  Should the sustainability of the buildup of our foreign indebtedness come into question, the exchange value of the dollar may well decline, imparting pressures on prices in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn the recent economic environment, however, the widening of the trade and current account deficits had some beneficial aspects.  It provided a safety valve for strong U.S. domestic demand, thereby helping to restrain pressures on U.S. resources.  It also cushioned, to some extent, economic weakness in our trading partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t Moreover, decreasing import prices, which partly came from the appreciation of the dollar through mid-summer, contributed to low overall U.S. inflation, as did ample manufacturing capacity in the United States and lower prices for oil and other commodities stemming from the weak activity abroad.  The marked drop in energy prices significantly contributed to the subdued, less than 1 percent, increase in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures during 1998.  In addition, supported by rapid accumulation of more efficient capital, the growth of labor productivity picked up last year, allowing nominal labor compensation to post another sizable gain without putting added upward pressure on costs and prices.  I shall return to an analysis of the extraordinary performance of inflation later in my remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe Federal Open Market Committee conducted monetary policy last year with the aim of sustaining the remarkable combination of economic expansion and low inflation.  At its meetings from March to July, the inflation risks accompanying the continued strength of domestic demand and the tightening of labor markets necessitated that the FOMC place itself on heightened inflation alert.  Although the FOMC kept the nominal federal funds rate unchanged, it allowed the real funds rate to rise with continuing declines in inflation and, presumably, inflation expectations.  In August, the FOMC returned to an unbiased policy predilection in response to the adverse implications for the U.S. outlook of worsening conditions in foreign economies and in global financial markets, including our own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tShortly thereafter, a further deterioration in financial market conditions began to pose a more serious threat to economic stability.  In the wake of the Russian crisis and subsequent difficulties in other emerging-market economies, investors perceived that the uncertainties in financial markets had broadened appreciably and as a consequence they became decidedly more risk averse.  Safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasury securities intensified at the expense of private debt securities.  As a result, quality spreads escalated dramatically, especially for lower-rated issuers.  Many financial markets turned illiquid, with wider bid-asked spreads and heightened price volatility, and issuance was disrupted in some private securities markets.  Even the liquidity in the market for seasoned issues of U.S. Treasury securities dried up, as investors shifted toward the more actively traded, recently issued securities and dealers pared inventories, fearing that heightened price volatility posed an unacceptable risk to their capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tResponding to losses in foreign financial markets and to pressures from counterparties, highly leveraged investors began to unwind their positions, which further weighed on market conditions.  As credit became less available to business borrowers in capital markets, their demands were redirected to commercial banks, which reacted to the enlarged borrowing, and more uncertain business prospects, by tightening their standards and terms on such lending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo cushion the domestic economy from the impact of the increasing weakness in foreign economies and the less accommodative conditions in U.S. financial markets, the FOMC, beginning in late September, undertook three policy easings.  By mid-November, the FOMC had reduced the federal funds rate from 5-1/2 percent to 4-3/4 percent.  These actions were taken to rebalance the risks to the outlook, and, in the event, the markets have recovered appreciably.  Our economy has weathered the disturbances with remarkable resilience, though some yield and bid-asked spreads still reflect a hesitancy on the part of market participants to take on risk.  The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains appropriate as those disturbances abate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tTo date, domestic demand and hence employment and output have remained vigorous.  Real GDP is estimated to have risen at an annual rate exceeding 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  Although some slowing from this torrid pace is most likely in the first quarter, labor markets remain exceptionally tight and the economy evidently retains a great deal of underlying momentum despite the global economic problems and the still-visible remnants of the earlier financial turmoil in the United States.  At the same time, no evidence of any upturn in inflation has, as yet, surfaced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAbroad, the situation is mixed.  In some East Asian countries that, in recent years, experienced a loss of investor confidence, a severe currency depreciation, and a deep recession, early signs of stabilization and economic recovery have appeared.  This is particularly the case for Korea and Thailand.  Authorities in those countries, in the context of IMF stabilization programs, early on established appropriate macroeconomic policies and undertook significant structural reforms to buttress the banking system and repair the finances of the corporate sector.  As investor confidence has returned, exchange rates have risen and interest rates have fallen.  With persistence and follow-through on reforms, the future of those economies has promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe situations in some other emerging market economies are not as encouraging.  The Russian government's decision in mid-August to suspend payments on its domestic debt and devalue the ruble took markets by surprise.  Investor flight exacerbated the collapse of prices in Russian financial markets and led to a sharp depreciation of the ruble.  The earlier decline in output gathered momentum, and by late in the year inflation had moved up to a triple-digit annual rate.  Russia's stabilization program with the IMF has been on hold since the financial crisis hit, and the economic outlook there remains troubling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe Russian financial crisis immediately spilled over to some other countries, hitting Latin America especially hard.  Countering downward pressure on the exchange values of the affected currencies, interest rates moved sharply higher, especially in Brazil.  As a consequence of the high interest rates and growing economic uncertainty, Brazil's economic activity took a turn for the worse.  Higher interest rates also had negative consequences for the fiscal outlook, as much of Brazil's substantial domestic debt effectively carries floating interest rates.  With budget reform legislation encountering various setbacks, market confidence waned further and capital outflows from Brazil continued, drawing down foreign currency reserves.  Ultimately, the decision was taken to allow the real to float, and it subsequently depreciated sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBrazilian authorities must walk a very narrow, difficult path of restoring confidence and keeping inflation contained with monetary policy while dealing with serious fiscal imbalances.  Although the situation in Brazil remains uncertain, there has been limited contagion to other countries thus far.  Apparently, the slow onset of the crisis has enabled many parties with Brazilian exposures to hedge those positions or allow them to run off.  With the net exposure smaller, and increasingly held by those who both recognized the heightened risk and were willing to bear it, some of the elements that might have contributed to further contagion may have\", 'and international developments provide the backdrop for U.S. economic prospects.  Our economy\\'s performance should remain solid this year, though likely with a slower pace of economic expansion and a slightly higher rate of overall inflation than last year.  The stocks of business equipment, housing, and household durable goods have been growing rapidly to quite high levels relative to business sales or household incomes during the past few years, and some slowing in the growth of spending on these items seems a reasonable prospect.  Moreover, part of the rapid increase in spending, especially in the household sector, has resulted from the surge in wealth associated with a run-up in equity prices that is unlikely to be repeated.  And the purchasing power of income and wealth has been enhanced by declines in oil and other import prices, which also are unlikely to recur this year.  Assuming that aggregate demand decelerates, underlying inflation pressures, as captured by core price measures, in all likelihood will not intensify significantly in the year ahead, though the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments carefully.  We perceive stable prices as optimum for economic growth.  Both inflation and deflation raise volatility and risks that thwart maximum economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMost Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents foresee that economic growth this year will slow to a 2-1/2 to 3 percent rate.  Such growth would keep the unemployment rate about unchanged.  The central tendency of the Governors\\' and Presidents\\' predictions of CPI inflation is 2 to 2-1/2 percent.  This level represents a pickup from last year, when energy prices were falling, but it is in the vicinity of core CPI inflation over the last couple of years. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis outlook involves several risks.  The continuing downside risk posed by possible economic and financial instability around the world was highlighted earlier this year by the events in Brazil.  Although financial contagion elsewhere has been limited to date, more significant knock-on effects in financial markets and in the economies of Brazil\\'s important trading partners, including the United States, are still possible.  Moreover, the economies of several of our key industrial trading partners have shown evidence of weakness, which if it deepens could further depress demands for our exports.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAnother downside risk is that growth in capital spending, especially among manufacturers, could weaken appreciably if pressures on domestic profit margins mount and capacity utilization drops further.  And it remains to be seen whether corporate earnings will disappoint investors, even if the slowing of economic growth is only moderate.  Investors appear to have incorporated into current equity price levels both robust profit expectations and low compensation for risk.  As the economy slows to a more sustainable pace as expected, profit forecasts could be pared back, which together with a greater sense of vulnerability in business prospects could damp appetites for equities.  A downward correction to stock prices, and an associated increase in the cost of equity capital, could compound a slowdown in the growth of capital spending.  In addition, a stock market decline would tend to restrain consumption spending through its effect on household net worth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut on the upside, our economy has proved surprisingly robust in recent years.  More rapid increases in capital spending, productivity, real wages, and asset prices have combined to boost economic growth far more and far longer than many of us would have anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThis \"virtuous cycle\" has been able to persist because the behavior of inflation also has been surprisingly favorable, remaining well contained at levels of utilization of labor that in the past would have produced accelerating prices.  That it has not done so in recent years has been the result of a combination of special one-time factors holding down prices and more lasting changes in the processes determining inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAmong the temporary factors, the sizable declines in the prices of oil, other internationally traded commodities, and other imports contributed directly to holding down inflation last year, and also indirectly by reducing inflation expectations.  But these prices are not likely to fall further, and they could begin to rise as some Asian economies revive and the effects of the net depreciation of the dollar since mid-summer are felt more strongly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAt the same time, however, recent experience does seem to suggest that the economy has become less inflation prone than in the past, so that the chances of an inflationary breakout arguably are, at least for now, less than they would have been under similar conditions in earlier cycles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSeveral years ago I suggested that worker insecurity might be an important reason for unusually damped inflation.  From the early 1990s through 1996, survey results indicated that workers were becoming much more concerned about being laid off.  Workers\\' underlying fear of technology-driven job obsolescence, and hence willingness to stress job security over wage increases, appeared to have suppressed labor cost pressures despite a reduced unemployment rate.  More recently, that effect seems to have diminished in part.  So while job loss fears probably contributed to wage and price suppression through 1996, it does not appear that a further heightening of worker insecurity about employment prospects can explain the more recent improved behavior of inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tInstead, a variety of evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, suggests that the source of recent restrained inflation may be emanating more from employers than from employees.  In the current economic setting, businesses sense that they have lost pricing power and generally have been unwilling to raise wages any faster than they can support at current price levels.  Firms have evidently concluded that if they try to increase their prices, their competitors will not follow, and they will lose market share and profits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tGiven the loss of pricing power, it is not surprising that individual employers resist pay increases.  But why has pricing power of late been so delimited?  Monetary policy certainly has played a role in constraining the rise in the general level of prices and damping inflation expectations over the 1980s and 1990s.  But our current discretionary monetary policy has difficulty anchoring the price level over time in the same way that the gold standard did in the last century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEnhanced opportunities for productive capital investment to hold down costs also may have helped to damp inflation.  Through the 1970s and 1980s, firms apparently found it easier and more profitable to seek relief from rising nominal labor costs through price increases than through cost-reducing capital investments.  Price relief evidently has not been available in recent years.  But relief from cost pressures has.  The newer technologies have made capital investment distinctly more profitable, enabling firms to substitute capital for labor far more productively than they would have a decade or two ago. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tStarting in 1993, capital investment, especially in high-tech equipment, rose sharply beyond normal cyclical experience, apparently the result of expected increases in rates of return on the new investment.  Had the profit expectations not been realized, one would have anticipated outlays to fall back.  Instead, their growth accelerated through the remainder of the decade. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMore direct evidence confirms improved underlying profitability.  According to rough estimates, labor and capital productivity has risen significantly during the past five years.  It seems likely that the synergies of advances in laser, fiber optic, satellite, and computer technologies with older technologies have enlarged the pool of opportunities to achieve a rate of return above the cost of capital.  Moreover, the newer technologies have facilitated a dramatic foreshortening of the lead times on the delivery of capital equipment over the past decade, presumably allowing businesses to react more expeditiously to an actual or expected rise in nominal compensation costs than, say, they could have in the 1980s.  In addition, the surge in investment not only has restrained costs, it has also increased industrial capacity faster than factory output has risen.  The resulting slack in product markets has put greater competitive pressure on businesses to hold down prices, despite taut labor markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\tThe role of technology in damping inflation is manifest not only in its effects on U.S. productivity and costs, but also through international trade, where technological developments have progressively broken down barriers to cross-border trade.  The enhanced competition in tradable goods has enabled excess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment worldwide supply and exert restraint on prices in all countries\\' markets.  The resulting price discipline also has constrained nominal wage gains in internationally tradable goods industries.  As workers have attempted to shift to other sectors, gains in nominal wages and increases in prices in nontradeable goods industries have been held down as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe process of price containment has potentially become, to some extent, self-reinforcing.  Lower inflation in recent years has altered expectations.  Workers no longer believe that escalating gains in nominal wages are needed to reap respectable increases in real wages, and their remaining sense of job insecurity is reinforcing this.  Since neither firms nor their competitors can count any longer on a general inflationary tendency to validate decisions to raise their own prices, each company feels compelled to concentrate on efforts to hold down costs.  The availability of new technology to each company and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps to boost productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIt is difficult to judge whether these significant shifts in the market environment in which firms function are sufficient to account for our benign overall price behavior during the past half decade.  Undoubtedly, other factors have been at work as well, including those temporary factors I mentioned earlier and some more lasting I have not discussed, such as worldwide deregulation and privatization, and the freeing up of resources previously employed to produce military products that was brought about by the end of the cold war.  There also may be other contributory forces lurking unseen in the wings that will only become clear in time.  Over the longer run, of course, the actions of the central bank determine the degree of overall liquidity and hence rate of inflation.  It is up to us to validate the favorable inflation developments of recent years.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAlthough the pace of productivity increase has picked up in recent years, the extraordinary strength of demand has meant that the substitution of capital for labor has not prevented us from rapidly depleting the pool of available workers.  This worker depletion constitutes a critical upside risk to the inflation outlook because it presumably cannot continue for very much longer without putting increasing pressure on labor markets and on costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe number of people willing to work can be usefully defined as the unemployed component of the labor force plus those not actively seeking work, and thus not counted in the labor force, but who nonetheless say they would like a job if they could get one.  This pool of potential workers aged 16 to 64 currently numbers about 10 million, or just 5-3/4 percent of that group\\'s population--the lowest such percentage on record, which begins in 1970, and 2-1/2 percentage points below its average over that period.  The rapid increase in aggregate demand has generated growth of employment in excess of growth in population, causing the number of potential workers to fall since the mid-1990s at a rate of a bit under 1 million annually.  We cannot judge with precision how much further this level can decline without sparking ever greater upward pressures on wages and prices.  But, should labor market conditions continue to tighten, there has to be some point at which the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably', 'the Committee elected to ratify the provisional ranges for all three aggregates that it had established last July.  Specifically, the Committee again has set growth rate ranges over the four quarters of 1999 of 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt.  As in previous years, the Committee interpreted the ranges for the broader monetary aggregates as benchmarks for what money growth would be under conditions of price stability and sustainable economic growth, assuming historically typical velocity behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLast year, these monetary aggregates far overshot the upper bounds of their annual ranges.  While', \"meetings has discussed not only the stance of policy, but also when and how it communicates its views of the evolving economic situation to the public.  The FOMC's objective is to release as much information about monetary policy decision making, and as promptly, as is consistent with maintaining an effective deliberative process and avoiding roiling markets unnecessarily.  Since early 1994, each change in the target nominal federal funds rate has been announced immediately with a brief rationale for the action.  The FOMC resolved at its December meeting to take advantage of an available, but unused policy, originally stated in early 1995, of releasing, on an infrequent basis, a statement immediately after some FOMC meetings at which the stance of monetary policy has not been changed.  The Federal Reserve will release such a statement when it wishes to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy.  Such an announcement need not be made after every change in the tilt of the directive.  Instead, this option would be reserved for situations in which the consensus of the Committee clearly had shifted significantly, though not by enough to change current policy, and in which the absence of an explanation risked misleading markets about the prospects\", \"I'd like to address an issue that has been receiving increasing attention--the century date change.  While no one can say that the rollover to the year 2000 will be trouble free, I am impressed by the efforts to date to address the problem in the banking and financial system.  For our part, the Federal Reserve System has now completed remediation and testing of 101 of its 103 mission-critical applications, with the remaining two to be replaced by the end of March.  We opened a test facility in June at which more than 6000 depository institutions to date have conducted tests of their Y2K compliant systems, and we are well along in our risk mitigation and contingency planning activities.  As a precautionary measure, the Federal Reserve has acted to increase the currency in inventory by about one-third to approximately $200 billion in late 1999 and has other contingency arrangements available if needed.  While we do not expect currency demand to increase dramatically, the Federal Reserve believes it is important for the public to have confidence in the availability of cash in advance of the rollover.  As a result of these kinds of activities, I can say with assurance that the Federal Reserve will be ready in both its operations and planning activities for the millennium rollover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe banking industry is also working hard, and with evident success, to prepare for the event.  By the end of the first quarter, every institution in the industry will have been subject to two rounds of on-site Y2K examinations.  The Federal Reserve, like the other regulators, has found that only a small minority of institutions has fallen behind in their preparations, and those institutions have been targeted for additional follow-up and, as necessary, formal enforcement actions.  The overwhelming majority of the industry has made impressive progress in their remediation, testing, and contingency\", 'feel proud of their recent economic achievements.  Competitive markets, with open trade both domestically and internationally, have kept our production efficient and on the expanding frontier of technological innovation.  The determination of Americans to improve their skills and knowledge has allowed workers to be even more productive, elevating their real earnings.  Macroeconomic policies have provided a favorable setting for the public to take greatest advantage of opportunities to improve its economic well being.  The restrained fiscal policy of the Administration and the Congress has engendered the welcome advent of a unified budget surplus, freeing up funds for capital investment.

      "[\"1999 has been an exceptional year for the American economy, but a challenging one for American monetary policy.  Through the first six months of this year, the U.S. economy has further extended its remarkable performance:  Almost 1-1/4 million jobs were added to payrolls on net, and gross domestic product apparently expanded at a brisk pace, perhaps near that of the prior three years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the root of this impressive expansion of economic activity has been a marked acceleration in the productivity of our nation's workforce.  This productivity growth has allowed further healthy advances in real wages and has permitted activity to expand at a robust clip while helping to foster price stability.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast fall, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased monetary policy to counter a seizing-up of financial markets that threatened to disrupt economic activity significantly.  As those markets recovered, the FOMC had to assess whether that policy stance remained appropriate.  By late last month, when it became apparent that much of the financial strain of last fall had eased, that foreign economies were firming, and that demand in the United States was growing at an unsustainable pace, the FOMC raised its intended federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to 5 percent.  To have refrained from doing so in our judgment would have put the U.S. economy's expansion at risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf nothing else, the experience of the last decade has reinforced earlier evidence that a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth is price stability.  While product prices have remained remarkably restrained in the face of exceptionally strong demand and expanding potential supply, it is imperative that we do not become complacent.\\r\\n \\r\\n The already shrunken pool of job-seekers and considerable strength of aggregate demand suggest that the Federal Reserve will need to be especially alert to inflation risks.  Should productivity fail to continue to accelerate and demand growth persist or strengthen, the economy could overheat.  That would engender inflationary pressures and put the sustainability of this unprecedented period of remarkable growth in jeopardy.  One indication that inflation risks were rising would be a tendency for labor markets to tighten further.  But the FOMC also needs to continue to assess whether the existing degree of pressure in these markets is consistent with sustaining our low-inflation environment.  If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude imbalances from arising that would only require a more disruptive adjustment later--one that could impair the expansion and bring into question whether the many gains already\", \"forces have been shaping recent developments in the U.S. economy.  One has been a recovery of financial markets from the disruptions of last fall.  By the end of 1998, the extreme withdrawal from risk-taking and consequent seizing-up of markets had largely dissipated.  This year, risk spreads have narrowed further--though generally not to the unrealistically low levels of a year ago--and a heavy volume of issuance in credit markets has signaled a return to their more-normal functioning.  Equity prices have risen to new highs and, in the process, have elevated price-earnings ratios to historic levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n Abroad, many financial markets and economies also have improved.  Brazil weathered a depreciation of its currency with limited fallout on its neighbors.  In Asia, a number of the emerging market economies seemed to be reviving after the trying adjustments of the previous year or so.  Progress has not been universal, and in many economies prospects remain clouded, depending importantly on the persistence of efforts to make fundamental reforms whose necessity had been made so painfully obvious in the crises those economies endured.   Nonetheless, the risks of further major disruptions to financial and trade flows that had concerned the FOMC when it eased policy last fall have clearly diminished.  Improving global prospects also mean that the U.S. economy will no longer be experiencing declines in basic commodity and import prices that held down inflation in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the domestic economy, data becoming available this year have tended to confirm that productivity growth has stepped up.  It is this acceleration of productivity over recent years that has explained much of the surprising combination of a slowing in inflation and sustained rapid real growth.  Increased labor productivity has directly limited the rise of unit labor costs and accordingly damped pressures on prices.  This good inflation performance, reinforced also by falling import prices, in turn has fostered further declines in inflation expectations over recent years that bode well for pressures on costs and prices going forward.  \\r\\n \\r\\n In testimony before this committee several years ago, I raised the possibility that we were entering a period of technological innovation that occurs perhaps once every fifty or one-hundred years.  The evidence then was only marginal and inconclusive.  Of course, tremendous advances in computing and telecommunications were apparent, but their translations into improved overall economic efficiency and rising national productivity were conjectural at best.  While the growth of output per hour had shown some signs of quickening, the normal variations exhibited by such data in the past were quite large.  More intriguing was the remarkable surge in capital investment after 1993, especially in high-tech goods, a full two years after a general recovery was under way.  This suggested a marked increase in the perceived prospective rates of return on the newer technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat American productivity growth has picked up over the past five years or so has become increasingly evident.  Nonfarm business productivity (on a methodologically consistent basis) grew at an average rate of a bit over 1 percent per year in the 1980s.  In recent years, productivity growth has picked up to more than 2 percent, with the past year averaging about 2-1/2 percent.\\r\\n \\r\\n To gauge the potential for similar, if not larger, gains in productivity going forward, we need to attempt to arrive at some understanding of what has occurred to date.  A good deal of the acceleration in output per hour has reflected the sizable increase in the stock of labor-saving equipment.  But that is not the whole story.  Output has grown beyond what normally would have been expected from increased inputs of labor and capital alone.  Business restructuring and the synergies of the new technologies have enhanced productive efficiencies.  American industry quite generally has shared an improved level of efficiency and cost containment through high-tech capital investment, not solely newer industries at the cutting edge of innovation.  Our century-old motor vehicle industry, for example, has raised output per hour by a dramatic 4-1/2 percent annually on average in the past two years, compared with a lackluster 1-1/4 percent on average earlier this decade.  Much the same is true of many other mature industries, such as steel, textiles, and other stalwarts of an earlier age.  This has confirmed the earlier indications of an underlying improvement in rates of return on the newer technologies and their profitable synergies with the existing capital stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese developments have created a broad range of potential innovations that have granted firms greater ability to profitably displace costly factors of production whenever profit margins have been threatened.  Moreover, the accelerating use of newer technologies has markedly enhanced the flexibility of our productive facilities.  It has dramatically reduced the lead times on the acquisition of new equipment and enabled firms to adjust quickly to changing market demands.  This has indirectly increased productive capacity and effectively, at least for now, eliminated production bottlenecks and the shortages and price pressures they inevitably breed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis greater ability to pare costs, increase production flexibility, and expand capacity are arguably the major reasons why inflationary pressures have been held in check in recent years.  Others have included the one-time fall in the prices of oil, other commodities, and imports more generally.  In addition, a breaking down of barriers to cross-border trade, owing both to the new technologies and to the reduction of government restrictions on trade, has intensified the pressures of competition, helping to contain prices.  Coupled with the decline in military spending worldwide, this has freed up resources for more productive endeavors, especially in a number of previously nonmarket economies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore generally, the consequent erosion of pricing power has imparted an important imperative to hold down costs.  The availability of new technology to each company and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps to reduce costs, which translates on a consolidated basis into increased national productivity.\\r\\n \\r\\n The acceleration in productivity owes importantly to new information technologies.  Prior to this IT revolution, most of twentieth-century business decisionmaking had been hampered by limited information.  Owing to the paucity of timely knowledge of customers' needs, the location of inventories, and the status of material flows throughout complex production systems, businesses built in substantial redundancies.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoubling up on materials and staffing was essential as a cushion against the inevitable misjudgments made in real time when decisions were based on information that was hours, days, or even weeks old.  While businesspeople must still operate in an uncertain world, the recent years' remarkable surge in the availability of real-time information has enabled them to remove large swaths of inventory safety stocks, redundant capital equipment, and layers of workers, while arming them with detailed data to fine-tune specifications to most individual customer needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the remarkable progress witnessed to date, history counsels us to be quite modest about our ability to project the future path and pace of technology and its implications for productivity and economic growth.  We must remember that the pickup in productivity is relatively recent, and a key question is whether that growth will persist at a high rate, drop back toward the slower standard of much of the last twenty-five years, or climb even more.  By the last I do not just mean that productivity will continue to grow, but that it will grow at an increasingly faster pace through a continuation of the process that has so successfully contained inflation and supported economic growth in recent years.\\r\\n \\r\\n The business and financial community does not as yet appear to sense a pending flattening in this process of increasing productivity growth.  This is certainly the widespread impression imparted by corporate executives.  And it is further evidenced by the earnings forecasts of more than a thousand securities analysts who regularly follow S&P 500 companies on a firm-by-firm basis, which presumably embody what corporate executives are telling them.  While the level of these estimates is no doubt upwardly biased, unless these biases have significantly changed over time, the revisions of these estimates should be suggestive of changes in underlying economic forces.  Except for a short hiatus in the latter part of 1998, analysts' expectations of five-year earnings growth have been revised up continually since early 1995.  If anything, the pace of those upward revisions has quickened of late.  True, some of that may reflect a pickup in expected earnings of foreign affiliates, especially in Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia.  But most of this year's increase almost surely owes to domestic influences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are only a limited number of ways that the expected long-term growth of domestic profits can increase, and some we can reasonably rule out.  There is little evidence that company executives or security analysts have significantly changed their views in recent months of the longer-term outlook for continued price containment, the share of profits relative to wages, or anticipated growth of hours worked.  Rather, analysts and the company executives they talk to appear to be expecting that unit costs will be held in check, or even lowered, as sales expand.  Hence, implicit in upward revisions of their forecasts, when consolidated, is higher expected national productivity growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent data on costs and prices in recent years tend to confirm what aggregate data on output and hours worked indicate:  that productivity growth has risen.  With price inflation stable and domestic operating profit margins rising, the rate of increase in total consolidated unit costs must have been falling.\\r\\n \\r\\n Even taking into account the evidence of declining unit interest costs of nonfinancial corporations, unit labor cost increases (which constitute three quarters of total unit costs) must also be slowing.  Because until very recently growth of compensation per hour has been rising, albeit modestly, it follows that productivity growth must have been rising these past five years, as well.  Accelerating productivity is thus evident in underlying consolidated income statements of nonfinancial corporations, as well as in our more direct, though doubtless partly flawed, measures of output and input.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, we must also understand the limits to this process of productivity-driven growth.  To be sure, the recent acceleration in productivity has provided an offset to our taut labor markets by holding unit costs in check and by adding to the competitive pressures that have contained prices.  But once output-per-hour growth stabilizes, even if at a higher rate, any pickup in the growth of nominal compensation per hour will translate directly into a more-rapid rate of increase in unit labor costs, heightening the pressure on firms to raise the prices of the goods and services they sell.  Thus, should the increments of gains in technology that have fostered productivity slow, any extant pressures in the labor market should ultimately show through to product prices.\\r\\n \\r\\n Meanwhile, though, the impressive productivity growth of recent years also has had important implications for the growth of aggregate demand.  If productivity is driving up real incomes and profits--and, hence, gross domestic income--then gross domestic product must mirror this rise with some combination of higher sales of motor vehicles, other consumer goods, new homes, capital equipment, and net exports.  By themselves, surges in economic growth are not necessarily unsustainable--provided they do not exceed the sum of the rate of growth in the labor force and productivity for a protracted period.  However, when productivity is accelerating, it is very difficult to gauge when an economy is in the process of overheating.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such circumstances, assessing conditions in the labor market can be helpful in forming those judgments.  Employment growth has exceeded the growth in working-age population this past year by almost 1/2 percentage point.  While somewhat less than the spread between these growth rates over much of the past few years, this excess is still large enough to continue the further tightening of labor markets.  It implies that real GDP is growing faster than its potential.  To an important extent, this excess of the growth of demand over supply owes to the wealth effect as consumers increasingly perceive their capital gains in the stock and housing markets as permanent and, evidently as a consequence, spend part of them, an issue to which I shall return shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be little doubt that, if the pool of job seekers shrinks sufficiently, upward pressures on wage costs are inevitable, short--as I have put it previously--of a repeal of the law of supply and demand.  Such cost increases have invariably presaged rising inflation in the past, and presumably would in the future, which would threaten the economic expansion. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy themselves, neither rising wages nor swelling employment rolls pose a risk to sustained economic growth.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve welcomes such developments and has attempted to gauge its policy in recent years to allow the economy to realize its full, enhanced potential.  In doing so, we must remain concerned with evolving shorter-run imbalances that can constrain long-run economic expansion and job growth.\\r\\n \\r\\n With productivity growth boosting both aggregate demand and aggregate supply, the implications for the real market interest rates that are consistent with sustainable economic growth are not obvious.  In fact, current real rates, although somewhat high by historical standards, have been consistent with continuing rapid growth in an environment where, as a consequence of greater productivity growth, capital gains and high returns on investment give both households and businesses\", 'supply and demand were in balance, however, other aspects of the economic environment may exhibit imbalances that could have important implications for future developments.  For example, in recent years, as a number of analysts have pointed out, a significant shortfall has emerged in the private saving with which to finance domestic investment in plant and equipment and houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne offset to the decline in household saving out of income has been a major shift of the federal budget to surplus.  Of course, an important part of that budgetary improvement, in turn, owes to augmented revenues from capital gains and other taxes that have flowed from the rising market value of assets.  Still, the budget surpluses have helped to hold down interest rates and facilitate private spending.\\r\\n\\r\\n The remaining gap between private saving and domestic investment has been filled by a sizable increase in saving invested from abroad, largely a consequence of the technologically driven marked increase in rates of return on U.S. investments.  Moreover, in recent years, with many foreign economies faltering, U.S. investments have looked particularly attractive.  As U.S. international indebtedness mounts, however, and foreign economies revive, capital inflows from abroad that enable domestic investment to exceed domestic saving may be difficult to sustain.  Any resulting decline in demand for dollar assets could well be associated with higher market interest rates, unless', \"the Members of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks believe there are mechanisms in place that should help to slow the growth of spending to a pace more consistent with that of potential output growth.  Consumption growth should slow some, if, as seems most likely, outsized gains in share values are not repeated.  In that event, businesses may trim their capital spending plans, a tendency that would be reinforced by the higher level of market interest rates that borrowers now face.  But with large unexploited long-term profit opportunities stemming from still-burgeoning innovations and falling prices of many capital goods, the typical cyclical retrenchment could be muted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking to offset somewhat this anticipated slowing of the growth of domestic demand, our export markets can be expected to be more buoyant because of the revival in growth in many of our important trading partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter considering the various forces at work in the near term, most of the Federal Reserve governors and Bank presidents expect the growth rate of real GDP to be between 3-1/2 and 3-3/4 percent over the four quarters of 1999 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 2000.  The unemployment rate is expected to remain in the range of the past eighteen months.  \\r\\n \\r\\n Inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the consumer price index, is expected to be 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent over the four quarters of this year.  CPI increases thus far in 1999 have been greater than the average in 1998, but the governors and bank presidents do not anticipate a further pickup in inflation going forward.  An abatement of the recent run-up in energy prices would contribute to such a pattern, but policymakers' forecasts also reflect their determination to hold the line on inflation, through policy actions if necessary.  The central tendency of their CPI inflation forecasts for 2000\", \", the FOMC has had to wrestle with the issue of what policy setting has the capacity to sustain this remarkable expansion, now in its ninth year.  For monetary policy to foster maximum sustainable economic growth, it is useful to preempt forces of imbalance before they threaten economic stability.  But this may not always be possible--the future at times can be too opaque to penetrate.  When we can be preemptive, we should be, because modest preemptive actions can obviate more drastic actions at a later date that could destabilize the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should emphasize that preemptive policymaking is equally applicable in both directions, as has been evident over the years both in our inclination to raise interest rates when the potential for inflationary pressures emerged, as in the spring of 1994, or to lower rates when the more palpable risk was economic weakness, as in the fall of last year.  This even-handedness is necessary because emerging adverse trends may fall on either side of our long-run objective of price stability.  Stable prices allow households and firms to concentrate their efforts on what they do best: consuming, producing, saving, and investing.  A rapidly rising or a falling general price level would confound market signals and place strains on the system that ultimately may throttle economic expansion.\\r\\n \\r\\n In the face of uncertainty, the Federal Reserve at times has been willing to move policy based on an assessment that risks to the outlook were disproportionately skewed in one direction or the other, rather than on a firm conviction that, absent action, the economy would develop imbalances.  For instance, both the modest policy tightening of the spring of 1997 and some portion of the easing of last fall could be viewed as insurance against potential adverse economic outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have already indicated, by its June meeting the FOMC was of the view that the full extent of this insurance was no longer needed.  It also did not believe that its recent modest tightening would put the risks of inflation going forward completely into balance.  However, given the many uncertainties surrounding developments on both the supply and demand side of the economy, the FOMC did not want to foster the impression that it was committed in short order to tighten further.  Rather, it judged that it would need to evaluate the incoming data for more signs that further imbalances were likely to develop.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Preemptive policymaking requires that the Federal Reserve continually monitor economic conditions, update forecasts, and appraise the setting of its policy instrument.  Equity prices figure importantly in that forecasting process because they influence aggregate demand.  As I testified last month, the central bank cannot effectively directly target stock or other asset prices.  Should an asset bubble arise, or even if one is already in train, monetary policy properly calibrated can doubtless mitigate at least part of the impact on the economy.  And, obviously, if we could find a way to prevent or deflate emerging bubbles, we would be better off.  But identifying a bubble in the process of inflating may be among the most formidable challenges confronting a central bank, pitting its own assessment of fundamentals against the combined judgment of millions of investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy itself, the interpretation that we are currently enjoying productivity acceleration does not ensure that equity prices are not overextended.  There can be little doubt that if the nation's productivity growth has stepped up, the level of profits and their future potential would be elevated.  That prospect has supported higher stock prices.  The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future become relatively small.  Such straying above fundamentals could create problems for our economy when the inevitable adjustment occurs.  It is the job of economic policymakers to mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the\", \"in this overview of near-term economic developments if I did not relay the ongoing efforts of the Federal Reserve, other financial regulators, and the private sector to come to grips with the rollover of their computer systems at the start of the upcoming century.  While I have been in this business too long to promise that 2000 will open on an entirely trouble-free note, the efforts to address potential problems in the banking and financial system have been exhaustive.  For our part, the Federal Reserve System has now completed remediation and testing of all its mission-critical applications, including testing its securities and funds-transfer systems with our thousands of financial institution customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n As we have said previously, while we do not believe consumers need to hold excess cash because we expect the full array of payment options to work, we have taken precautions to ensure that ample currency is available.  Further, the Federal Reserve established a special liquidity facility at which sound depository institutions with good collateral can readily borrow at a slight penalty rate in the months surrounding the rollover.  The availability of this back-stop funding should make depository institutions more willing to provide loans and lines of credit to other financial institutions and businesses and to meet any deposit withdrawals as this century closes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banking industry is also working hard, and with evident success, to prepare for the event.  By the end of May, 98 percent of the nation's depository institutions examined by Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council agencies were making satisfactory progress on their Year 2000 preparations.  The agencies are now in the process of examining supervised institutions for compliance with the June 30 milestone date for completing testing and implementation of remediated mission-critical systems.  Supervisors also expect institutions to prepare business resumption contingency plans and to maintain open lines of communication with customers and counterparties about their own readiness.  The few remaining laggards among financial institutions in Year 2000 preparedness have been targeted for additional follow-up and, as necessary, will be subject to\", \"nation's ongoing favorable economic performance, not only has the broad majority of our people moved to a higher standard of living, but a strong economy also has managed to bring into the productive workforce many who had for too long been at its periphery.  The unemployment rate for those with less than a high-school education has declined from 10-3/4 percent in early 1994 to 6-3/4 percent today, twice the percentage point decline in the overall unemployment rate.  These gains have enabled large segments of our society to obtain skills on the job and the self-esteem associated with work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe questions before us today are what macroeconomic policy settings can best extend this favorable performance.  No doubt, a monetary policy focused on promoting price stability over the long run and a fiscal policy focused on enhancing national saving by accumulating budget surpluses have been key elements in creating an environment fostering the capital investment that has driven the gains to productivity and living standards.  I am confident that by maintaining this discipline, policymakers in the Congress, in the executive branch, and at the Federal Reserve will give our vital U.S. economy its best chance of\"]\n"

      "['another exemplary\\r\\n          performance in 1997.  Over the four quarters of last year,\\r\\n          real GDP expanded close to 4 percent, its fastest annual\\r\\n          increase in ten years.  To produce that higher output,\\r\\n          about 3 million Americans joined the nation\\'s payrolls, in\\r\\n          the process contributing to a reduction in the\\r\\n          unemployment rate to 4-3/4 percent, its lowest sustained\\r\\n          level since the late 1960s.  And our factories were working\\r\\n          more intensively too:  Industrial production increased 5-3/4 percent\\r\\n\\t\\t  last year, exceeding robust additions to\\r\\n          capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Those gains were shared widely.  The hourly wage\\r\\n          and salary structure rose about 4 percent, fueling\\r\\n          impressive increases in personal incomes.  Unlike some\\r\\n          prior episodes when faster wage rate increases mainly\\r\\n          reflected attempts to make up for more rapidly rising\\r\\n          prices of goods and services, the fatter paychecks that\\r\\n          workers brought home represented real increments to\\r\\n          purchasing power.  Measured consumer price inflation\\r\\n          came in at 1-3/4 percent over the twelve months of 1997,\\r\\n          down about 1-1/2 percentage points from the pace of the\\r\\n          prior year.  While swings in the prices of food and fuel\\r\\n          contributed to this decline, both narrower price indexes\\r\\n          excluding those items and broader ones including all goods\\r\\n          and services produced in the United States also paint a\\r\\n          portrait of continued progress toward price stability.\\r\\n          Businesses, for the most part, were able to pay these\\r\\n          higher real wages while still increasing their earnings.\\r\\n          Although aggregate data on profits for all of 1997 are not\\r\\n          yet available, corporate profit margins most likely\\r\\n          remained in an elevated range not seen consistently since\\r\\n          the 1960s.  These healthy gains in earnings and the\\r\\n          expectations of more to come provided important support\\r\\n          to the equity market, with most major stock price indexes\\r\\n          gaining more than 20 percent over the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The strong growth of the real income of workers\\r\\n          and corporations is not unrelated to the economy\\'s\\r\\n          continued good performance on inflation.  Taken together,\\r\\n          recent evidence supports the view that such low inflation,\\r\\n          as closely approaching price stability as we have known in\\r\\n          the United States in three decades, engenders many\\r\\n          benefits.  When changes in the general price level are\\r\\n          small and predictable, households and firms can plan more\\r\\n          securely for the future.  The perception of reduced risk\\r\\n          encourages investment.  Low inflation also exerts a\\r\\n          discipline on costs, fostering efforts to enhance\\r\\n          productivity.  Productivity is the ultimate source of rising\\r\\n          standards of living, and we witnessed a notable pickup in\\r\\n          this measure in the past two years.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The robust economy has facilitated the efforts of\\r\\n          the Congress and the Administration to restore balance in\\r\\n          the unified federal budget.  As I have indicated to the\\r\\n          Congress on numerous occasions, moving beyond this\\r\\n          point and putting the budget in significant surplus would\\r\\n          be the surest and most direct way of increasing national\\r\\n          saving.  In turn, higher national saving, by promoting\\r\\n          lower real long-term interest rates, helps spur spending to\\r\\n          outfit American firms and their workers with the modern\\r\\n          equipment they need to compete successfully on world\\r\\n          markets.  We have seen a partial down payment of the\\r\\n          benefits of better budget balance already:  It seems\\r\\n          reasonable to assume that the decline in longer-term\\r\\n          Treasury yields last year owed, in part, to reduced\\r\\n          competition--current and prospective--from the federal\\r\\n          government for scarce private saving.  However, additional\\r\\n          effort remains to be exerted to address the effects on\\r\\n          federal entitlement spending of the looming shift within\\r\\n          the next decade in the nation\\'s retirement demographics.\\r\\n\\r\\n               As I noted earlier, our nation has been experiencing\\r\\n          a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour\\r\\n          worked--in recent years.  The dramatic improvements in\\r\\n          computing power and communication and information\\r\\n          technology appear to have been a major force behind this\\r\\n          beneficial trend.  Those innovations, together with fierce\\r\\n          competitive pressures in our high-tech industries to make\\r\\n          them available to as many homes, offices, stores, and shop\\r\\n          floors as possible, have produced double-digit annual\\r\\n          reductions in prices of capital goods embodying new\\r\\n          technologies.  Indeed, many products considered to be at\\r\\n          the cutting edge of technology as recently as two to three\\r\\n          years ago have become so standardized and inexpensive\\r\\n          that they have achieved near \"commodity\" status, a\\r\\n          development that has allowed businesses to accelerate\\r\\n          their accumulation of more and better capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Critical to this process has been the rapidly\\r\\n          increasing efficiency of our financial markets--itself a\\r\\n          product of the new technologies and of significant market\\r\\n          deregulation over the years.  Capital now flows with\\r\\n          relatively little friction to projects embodying new ideas.\\r\\n          Silicon Valley is a tribute both to American ingenuity and\\r\\n          to the financial system\\'s ever-increasing ability to supply\\r\\n          venture capital to the entrepreneurs who are such a\\r\\n          dynamic force in our economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n               With new high-tech tools, American businesses have\\r\\n          shaved transportation costs, managed their production and\\r\\n          use of inventories more efficiently, and broadened market\\r\\n          opportunities.   The threat of rising costs in tight labor\\r\\n          markets has imparted a substantial impetus to efforts to\\r\\n          take advantage of possible efficiencies.  In my Humphrey-Hawkins\\r\\n\\t\\t  testimony last July, I discussed the likelihood\\r\\n          that the sharp acceleration in capital investment in\\r\\n          advanced technologies beginning in 1993 reflected\\r\\n          synergies of new ideas, embodied in increasingly\\r\\n          inexpensive new equipment, that have elevated expected\\r\\n          returns and have broadened investment opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\n               More recent evidence remains consistent with the\\r\\n          view that this capital spending has contributed to a\\r\\n          noticeable pickup in productivity--and probably by more\\r\\n          than can be explained by usual business cycle forces.  For\\r\\n          one, the combination of continued low inflation and\\r\\n          stable to rising domestic profit margins implies quite\\r\\n          subdued growth in total consolidated unit business costs.\\r\\n          With labor costs constituting more than two-thirds of\\r\\n          those costs and labor compensation per hour accelerating,\\r\\n          productivity must be growing faster, and that stepup must\\r\\n          be roughly in line with the increase in compensation\\r\\n          growth.  For another, our more direct observations on\\r\\n          output per hour roughly tend to confirm that productivity\\r\\n          has picked up significantly in recent years, although how\\r\\n          much the ongoing trend of productivity has risen remains\\r\\n          an open question.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The acceleration in productivity, however, has been\\r\\n          exceeded by the strengthening of demand for goods and\\r\\n          services.  As a consequence, employers had to expand\\r\\n          payrolls at a pace well in excess of the growth of the\\r\\n          working age population that profess a desire for a job,\\r\\n          including new immigrants.  As I pointed out last year in\\r\\n          testimony before the Congress, that gap has been\\r\\n          accommodated by declines in both the officially\\r\\n          unemployed and those not actively seeking work but\\r\\n          desirous of working.  The number of people in those two\\r\\n          categories decreased at a rate of about one million per year\\r\\n          on average over the last four years.  By December 1997,\\r\\n          the sum had declined to a seasonally adjusted 10-1/2\\r\\n          million, or 6 percent of the working age population, the\\r\\n          lowest ratio since detailed information on this series first\\r\\n          became available in 1970.  Anecdotal information from\\r\\n          surveys of our twelve Reserve Banks attests to our ever\\r\\n          tightening labor markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Rapidly rising demand for labor has had enormous\\r\\n          beneficial effects on our work force.  Previously low- or\\r\\n          unskilled workers have been drawn into the job market\\r\\n          and have obtained training and experience that will help\\r\\n          them even if they later change jobs.  Large numbers of\\r\\n          underemployed have been moved up the career ladder to\\r\\n          match their underlying skills, and many welfare recipients\\r\\n          have been added to payrolls as well, to the benefit of their\\r\\n          long-term job prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The recent acceleration of wages likely has owed in\\r\\n          part to the ever-tightening labor market and in part to\\r\\n          rising productivity growth, which, through competition,\\r\\n          induces firms to grant higher wages.  It is difficult at this\\r\\n          time, however, to disentangle the relative contributions of\\r\\n          these factors.  What is clear is that, unless demand growth\\r\\n          softens or productivity growth accelerates even more, we\\r\\n          will gradually run out of new workers who can be\\r\\n          profitably employed.  It is not possible to tell how many\\r\\n          more of the 6 percent of the working-age population who\\r\\n          want to work but do not have jobs can be added to\\r\\n          payrolls.  A significant number are so-called frictionally\\r\\n          unemployed, as they have left one job but not yet chosen\\r\\n          to accept another.  Still others have chosen to work in\\r\\n          only a limited geographic area where their skills may not\\r\\n          be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Should demand for new workers continue to exceed\\r\\n          new supply, we would expect wage gains increasingly to\\r\\n          exceed productivity growth, squeezing profit margins and\\r\\n          eventually leading to a pickup in inflation.  Were a\\r\\n          substantial pickup in inflation to occur, it could, by\\r\\n          stunting economic growth, reverse much of the remarkable\\r\\n          labor market progress of recent years.  I will be discussing\\r\\n          our assessment of these and other possibilities and their\\r\\n          bearing on the', 'monetary policy has been\\r\\n          its most effective when it has been preemptive.  The\\r\\n          lagging relationship between the Federal Reserve\\'s policy\\r\\n          instrument and spending, and, even further removed,\\r\\n          inflation, implies that if policy actions are delayed until\\r\\n          prices begin to pick up, they will be too late to fend off at\\r\\n          least some persistent price acceleration and attendant\\r\\n          economic instabilities.  Preemptive policymaking is keyed\\r\\n          to judging how widespread are emerging inflationary\\r\\n          forces, and when, and to what degree, those forces will be\\r\\n          reflected in actual inflation.  For most of last year, the\\r\\n          evident strains on resources were sufficiently severe to\\r\\n          steer the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\\r\\n          toward being more inclined to tighten than to ease\\r\\n          monetary policy.  Indeed, in March, when it became\\r\\n          apparent that strains on resources seemed to be\\r\\n          intensifying, the FOMC imposed modest incremental\\r\\n          restraint, raising its intended federal funds rate 1/4\\r\\n          percentage point, to 5-1/2 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n               We did not increase the federal funds rate again\\r\\n          during the summer and fall, despite further tightening of\\r\\n          the labor market.  Even though the labor market heated\\r\\n          up and labor compensation rose, measured inflation fell,\\r\\n          owing to the appreciation of the dollar, weakness in\\r\\n          international commodity prices, and faster productivity\\r\\n          growth.  Those restraining forces were more evident in\\r\\n          goods-price inflation, which in the CPI slowed\\r\\n          substantially to only about 1/2 percent in 1997, than on\\r\\n          service-price inflation, which moderated much less--to\\r\\n          around 3 percent.  Providers of services appeared to be\\r\\n          more pressed by mounting strains in labor markets.\\r\\n          Hourly wages and salaries in service-producing sectors rose\\r\\n          4-1/2 percent last year, up considerably from the prior\\r\\n          year and almost 1-1/2 percentage points faster than in\\r\\n          goods-producing sectors.  However, a significant portion of\\r\\n          that differential, but by no means all, traced to\\r\\n          commissions in the financial and real estate services sector\\r\\n          related to one-off increases in transactions prices and in\\r\\n          volumes of activity, rather than to increases in the\\r\\n          underlying wage structure.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Although the nominal federal funds rate was\\r\\n          maintained after March, the apparent drop in inflation\\r\\n          expectations over the balance of 1997 induced some\\r\\n          firming in the stance of monetary policy by one important\\r\\n          measure--the real federal funds rate, or the nominal federal\\r\\n          funds rate less a proxy for inflation expectations.  Some\\r\\n          analysts have dubbed the contribution of the reduction in\\r\\n          inflation expectations to raising the real federal funds rate\\r\\n          a \"passive\" tightening, in that it increased the amount of\\r\\n          monetary policy restraint in place without an explicit vote\\r\\n          by the FOMC.  While the tightening may have been\\r\\n          passive in that sense, it was by no means inadvertent.\\r\\n          Members of the FOMC took some comfort in the upward\\r\\n          trend of the real federal funds rate over the year and the\\r\\n          rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar because\\r\\n          such additional restraint was viewed as appropriate given\\r\\n          the strength of spending and building strains on labor\\r\\n          resources.  They also recognized that in virtually all other\\r\\n          respects financial markets remained quite accommodative\\r\\n          and, indeed, judging by the rise in equity prices, were\\r\\n          providing additional', \"that domestic demand\\r\\n          retained considerable momentum at the outset of this\\r\\n          year.  Production and employment have been on a strong\\r\\n          uptrend in recent months.  Confident households,\\r\\n          enjoying gains in income and wealth and benefitting from\\r\\n          the reductions in intermediate- and longer-term interest\\r\\n          rates to date, should continue to increase their spending.\\r\\n          Firms should find financing available on relatively\\r\\n          attractive terms to fund profitable opportunities to\\r\\n          enhance efficiency by investing in new capital equipment.\\r\\n          By itself, this strength in spending would seem to presage\\r\\n          intensifying pressures in labor markets and on prices.  Yet,\\r\\n          the outlook for total spending on goods and services\\r\\n          produced in the United States is less assured of late\\r\\n          because of storm clouds massing over the Western Pacific\\r\\n          and heading our way.\\r\\n\\r\\n               This is not the place to examine in detail what\\r\\n          triggered the initial problems in Asian financial markets\\r\\n          and why the subsequent deterioration has been so\\r\\n          extreme.  I covered that subject recently before several\\r\\n          committees of the Congress.  Rather, I shall confine my\\r\\n          discussion this morning to the likely consequences of the\\r\\n          Asian crisis for demand and inflation in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n               With the crisis curtailing the financing available in\\r\\n          foreign currencies, many Asian economies have had no\\r\\n          choice but to cut back their imports sharply.  Disruptions\\r\\n          to their financial systems and economies more generally\\r\\n          will further damp demands for our exports of goods and\\r\\n          services.  American exports should be held down as well by\\r\\n          the appreciation of the dollar, which will make the prices\\r\\n          of competing goods produced abroad more attractive, just\\r\\n          as foreign-produced goods will be relatively more attractive\\r\\n          to buyers here at home.  As a result, we can expect a\\r\\n          worsening net export position to exert a discernible drag\\r\\n          on total output in the United States.  For a time, such\\r\\n          restraint might be reinforced by a reduced willingness of\\r\\n          U.S. firms to accumulate inventories as they foresee\\r\\n          weaker demand ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The forces of Asian restraint could well be providing\\r\\n          another, more direct offset to inflationary impulses arising\\r\\n          domestically in the United States.  In the wake of\\r\\n          weakness in Asian economies and of lagged effects of the\\r\\n          appreciation of the dollar more generally, the dollar prices\\r\\n          of our non-oil imports are likely to decline further in the\\r\\n          months ahead.  These lower import prices are apparently\\r\\n          already making domestic producers hesitant to raise their\\r\\n          own prices for fear of losing market share, further\\r\\n          contributing to the restraint on overall prices.  Lesser\\r\\n          demands for raw materials on the part of Asian economies\\r\\n          as their activity slows should help to keep world\\r\\n          commodity prices denominated in dollars in check.\\r\\n          Import and commodity prices, however, will restrain U.S.\\r\\n          inflation only as long as they continue to fall, or to rise at\\r\\n          a slower rate than the pace of overall domestic product\\r\\n          prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The key question going forward is whether the\\r\\n          restraint building from the turmoil in Asia will be\\r\\n          sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might\\r\\n          otherwise result from the strength of domestic spending\\r\\n          and tightening labor markets.  The depth of the\\r\\n          adjustment abroad will depend on the extent of weakness\\r\\n          in the financial sectors of Asian economies and the speed\\r\\n          with which structural inefficiencies in the financial and\\r\\n          nonfinancial sectors of those economies are corrected.  If,\\r\\n          as we suspect, the restraint coming from Asia is sufficient\\r\\n          to bring the demand for American labor back into line\\r\\n          with the growth of the working-age population desirous of\\r\\n          working, labor markets will remain unusually tight, but\\r\\n          any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very\\r\\n          gradual, and readily reversible.  However, we cannot rule\\r\\n          out two other, more worrisome possibilities.  On the one\\r\\n          hand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be\\r\\n          offset significantly by Asian or other developments, the\\r\\n          U.S. economy would be on a track along which spending\\r\\n          could press too strongly against available resources to be\\r\\n          consistent with contained inflation.  On the other, we also\\r\\n          need to be alert to the possibility that the forces from Asia\\r\\n          might damp activity and prices by more than is desirable\\r\\n          by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of\\r\\n          net exports and the prices of imports.\\r\\n\\r\\n               When confronted at the beginning of this month\\r\\n          with these, for the moment, finely balanced, though\\r\\n          powerful forces, the members of the Federal Open Market\\r\\n          Committee decided that monetary policy should most\\r\\n          appropriately be kept on hold.  With the continuation of\\r\\n          a remarkable seven-year expansion at stake and so little\\r\\n          precedent to go by, the range of our intelligence gathering\\r\\n          in the weeks ahead must be wide and especially inclusive\\r\\n          of international developments.\\r\\n          The Forecasts of the Governors of the Federal Reserve\\r\\n          Board and the Presidents of the Federal Reserve\\r\\n          Banks.\\r\\n\\r\\n               In these circumstances, the forecasts of the\\r\\n          governors of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of\\r\\n          the Federal Reserve Banks for the performance of the U.S\\r\\n          economy over this year are more tentative than usual.\\r\\n          Based on information available through the first week of\\r\\n          February, monetary policymakers were generally of the\\r\\n          view that moderate economic growth is likely in store.\\r\\n          The growth rate of real GDP is most commonly seen as\\r\\n          between 2 and 2-3/4 percent over the four quarters of\\r\\n          1998.  Given the strong performance of real GDP, these\\r\\n          projections envisage the unemployment rate remaining in\\r\\n          the low range of the past half year.  Inflation, as measured\\r\\n          by the four-quarter percent change in the consumer price\\r\\n          index, is expected to be 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent in 1998--near\\r\\n\\t\\t   the low rate recorded in 1997.  This outlook\\r\\n          embodies the expectation that the effects of continuing\\r\\n          tightness in labor markets will be largely offset by\\r\\n          technical adjustments shaving a couple tenths from the\\r\\n          published CPI, healthy productivity growth, flat or\\r\\n          declining import prices, and little pressure in commodity\\r\\n          markets.  But the policymakers' forecasts also reflect their\\r\\n          determination to hold\", \"provisional ranges for the\\r\\n          monetary aggregates in 1998 that it had selected last July,\\r\\n          which, once again, encompass the growth rates associated\\r\\n          with conditions of approximate price stability, provided\\r\\n          that these aggregates act in accord with their pre-1990s\\r\\n          historical relationships with nominal income and interest\\r\\n          rates.  These ranges are identical to those that had\\r\\n          prevailed for 1997--1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6\\r\\n          percent for M3.  The FOMC also reaffirmed its range of 3\\r\\n          to 7 percent for the debt of the domestic nonfinancial\\r\\n          sectors for this year.  I should caution, though, that the\\r\\n          expectations of the governors and Reserve Bank presidents\\r\\n          for the expansion of nominal GDP in 1998 suggest that\\r\\n          growth of M2 in the upper half of its benchmark range is\\r\\n          a distinct possibility this year.  Given the continuing\\r\\n          strength of bank credit, M3 might even be above its range\\r\\n          as depositories use liabilities in this aggregate to fund loan\\r\\n          growth and securities acquisitions.  Nonfinancial debt\\r\\n          should come in around the middle portion of its range.\\r\\n          In the first part of the 1990s, money growth\\r\\n          diverged from historical relationships with income and\\r\\n          interest rates, in part as savers diversified into bond and\\r\\n          stock mutual funds, which had become more readily\\r\\n          available and whose returns were considerably more\\r\\n          attractive than those on deposits.  This anomalous\\r\\n          behavior of velocity severely set back most analysts'\\r\\n          confidence in the usefulness of M2 as an indicator of\\r\\n          economic developments.  In recent years, there have been\\r\\n          tentative signs that the historical relationship linking the\\r\\n          velocity of M2--measured as the ratio of nominal GDP to\\r\\n          the money stock--to the cost of holding M2 assets was\\r\\n          reasserting itself.  However, a persistent residual upward\\r\\n          drift in velocity over the past few years and its apparent\\r\\n          cessation very recently underscores our ongoing\\r\\n          uncertainty about the stability of this relationship.  The\\r\\n          FOMC will continue to observe the evolution of the\\r\\n          monetary and credit aggregates carefully, integrating\\r\\n          information about these variables with a wide variety of\\r\\n          other information in\", 'reflecting a balance of\\r\\n          strong countervailing forces, events in the months ahead\\r\\n          are not likely to unfold smoothly.  In that regard, I would\\r\\n          like to flag a few areas of concern about the economy\\r\\n          beyond those mentioned already regarding Asian\\r\\n          developments.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Without doubt, lenders have provided important\\r\\n          support to spending in the past few years by their\\r\\n          willingness to transact at historically small margins and in\\r\\n          large volumes.  Equity investors have contributed as well\\r\\n          by apparently pricing in the expectation of substantial\\r\\n          earnings gains and requiring modest compensation for the\\r\\n          risk that those expectations could be mistaken.\\r\\n          Approaching the eighth year of the economic expansion,\\r\\n          this is understandable in an economic environment that,\\r\\n          contrary to historical experience, has become increasingly\\r\\n          benign.  Businesses have been meeting obligations readily\\r\\n          and generating high profits, putting them in outstanding\\r\\n          financial health.\\r\\n\\r\\n               But we must be concerned about becoming too\\r\\n          complacent about evaluating repayment risks.  All too\\r\\n          often at this stage of the business cycle, the loans that\\r\\n          banks extend later make up a disproportionate share of\\r\\n          total nonperforming loans.  In addition, quite possibly,\\r\\n          twelve or eighteen months hence, some of the securities\\r\\n          purchased on the market could be looked upon with some\\r\\n          regret by investors.  As one of the nation\\'s bank\\r\\n          supervisors, the Federal Reserve will make every effort to\\r\\n          encourage banks to apply sound underwriting standards in\\r\\n          their lending.  Prudent lenders should consider a wide\\r\\n          range of economic situations in evaluating credit; to do\\r\\n          otherwise would risk contributing to potentially disruptive\\r\\n          financial problems down the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n               A second area of concern involves our nation\\'s\\r\\n          continuing role in the new high-tech international\\r\\n          financial system.  By joining with our major trading\\r\\n          partners and international financial institutions in helping\\r\\n          to stabilize the economies of Asia and promoting needed\\r\\n          structural changes, we are also encouraging the continued\\r\\n          expansion of world trade and global economic and\\r\\n          financial stability on which the ongoing increase of our\\r\\n          own standards of living depends.  If we were to cede our\\r\\n          role as a world leader, or backslide into protectionist\\r\\n          policies, we would threaten the source of much of our own\\r\\n          sustained economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n               A third risk is complacency about inflation\\r\\n          prospects.  The combination and interaction of significant\\r\\n          increases in productivity-improving technologies, sharp\\r\\n          declines in budget deficits, and disciplined monetary\\r\\n          policy has damped product price changes, bringing them\\r\\n          to near stability.  While part of this result owes to good\\r\\n          policy, part is the product of the fortuitous emergence of\\r\\n          new technologies and of some favorable price\\r\\n          developments in imported goods.  However, as history\\r\\n          counsels, it is unwise to count on any string of good\\r\\n          fortune to continue indefinitely.  At the same time,\\r\\n          though, it is also instructive to remember the words of an\\r\\n          old sage that \"luck is the residue of design.\"  He meant\\r\\n          that to some degree we can deliberately put ourselves in\\r\\n          position to experience good fortune and be better prepared\\r\\n          when misfortune strikes.  For example, the 1970s were\\r\\n          marked by two major oil-price shocks and a significant\\r\\n          depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar.  But\\r\\n          those misfortunes were, in part, the result of allowing\\r\\n          imbalances to build over the decade as policymakers lost\\r\\n          hold of the anchor provided by price stability.  Some of\\r\\n          what we now see helping rein in inflation pressures is more\\r\\n          likely to occur in an environment of stable prices and price\\r\\n          expectations that thwarts producers from indiscriminately\\r\\n          passing on higher costs, puts a premium on productivity\\r\\n          enhancement, and rewards more effectively investment in\\r\\n          physical and human capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Simply put, while the pursuit of price stability does\\r\\n          not rule out misfortune, it lowers its probability.  If firms\\r\\n          are convinced that the general price level will remain\\r\\n          stable, they will reserve increases in their sales prices of\\r\\n          goods and services as a last resort, for fear that such\\r\\n          increases could mean loss of market share.  Similarly, if\\r\\n          households are convinced of price stability, they will not\\r\\n          see variations in relative prices as reasons to change their\\r\\n          long-run inflation expectations.  Thus, continuing to make\\r\\n          progress toward this legislated objective will make future\\r\\n          supply shocks less likely and our nation\\'s economy less\\r\\n          vulnerable']\n"
