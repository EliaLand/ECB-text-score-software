    "The project aims to conduct textual analysis of the Federal Reserve's (FED) Monetary Policy Reports through the deployment of Python-based software. This report is written semi-annually and provided to Congress containing discussions on the \"conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects for the future.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we develop a web scraping script to extract textual data from the FED's website. Subsequently, we use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package to preprocess the text, including tokenization, stemming, and converting words to lowercase. Next, the Loughran McDonald Sentiment Dictionary is employed to transform the cleaned qualitative text data into a quantitative measure of the FED's communication tone. This communication measure is then be regressed against the output gap and inflation gap, obtained via API, to assess the sensitivity of the FED's communication to these macroeconomic variables. Throughout the project, we employ various visualisation and analysis packages to explore the data and conduct preliminary analysis. \n",

    "Finally, we plan to develop a user-friendly interface for easy access and interpretation of our findings. **IF WE GET TIME**"

2024\\nSemiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\\nChair Jerome H. Powell\\nBefore the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on March 7, 2024.\\nChairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\\nThe Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward these objectives over the past year.\\nWhile inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s (FOMC) objective of 2 percent, it has eased substantially, and the slowing in inflation has occurred without a significant increase in unemployment. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have been moving into better balance.\\nEven so, the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks and is acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. The FOMC is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\\nI will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\r\\nEconomic activity expanded at a strong pace over the past year. For 2023 as a whole, gross domestic product increased 3.1 percent, bolstered by solid consumer demand and improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.\\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have continued to come into better balance. Since the middle of last year, payroll job gains have averaged 239,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has remained near historical lows, at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, particularly among individuals aged 25 to 54, and a continued strong pace of immigration. Job vacancies have declined, and nominal wage growth has been easing. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. The strong labor market over the past two years has also helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.1\\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above the FOMC\\'s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent, a notable slowing from 2022 that was widespread across both goods and services prices. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\\nMonetary Policy\\r\\nAfter significantly tightening the stance of monetary policy since early 2022, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since its meeting last July. We have also continued to shrink our balance sheet at a brisk pace and in a predictable manner. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.\\nWe believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have seen in inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\\nThank you. I am happy to take your questions.\\n\\n1.
